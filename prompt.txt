As an AI language model, I don't generate prompts, but I can certainly assist you with creating one based on our conversation so far. Here's a summary of your tasks and the actions taken:

**AI Assistant Task Summary:**

User requested assistance with extracting specific information from an HTML file containing details about telephone numbers in Kazakhstan and Russia. The user initially wanted to automate the process using web scraping techniques, but later decided to perform the extraction manually.

The assistant provided a high-level outline for automating the extraction process using Python and BeautifulSoup, including loading the HTML, parsing it, extracting relevant data, cleaning and formatting the data, generating a JSON object, and saving or outputting the JSON.

After discussing the pros and cons of automation versus manual extraction, the user chose to proceed with manual extraction. The assistant then helped the user extract the necessary information from the provided HTML snippet and formatted it according to a specified JSON schema.

The user requested the removal of the "seeAlso" section from the JSON object and later asked to include the "notes" section back into the JSON. The assistant complied with both requests, providing the user with the final JSON object containing the extracted information.

**Prompt:**

Assist with extracting specific information from an HTML file detailing telephone numbers in Kazakhstan and Russia. Initially, explore options for automating the extraction using web scraping techniques in Python. However, upon consideration, opt for a manual approach. Guide the user through the process of extracting the required data points, such as area codes, allocation tables, and notes, and format them into a JSON object according to a predefined schema. Ensure that the final JSON includes all relevant sections as per the user's requirements.
