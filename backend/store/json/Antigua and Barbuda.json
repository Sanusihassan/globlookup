  "title": "Antigua and Barbuda telephone area code",
  "description": "Area code  268 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Antigua and Barbuda. The area code digit sequence translates to ANT on a standard US alphanumeric telephone keypad, providing a mnemonic designation. The area code was activated on April  1,  1996, by division of numbering plan area  809 which used to comprise all Caribbean countries and Bermuda. A permissive dialing period was in effect for one year until March  31,  1997. For local calling in Antigua and Barbuda, seven-digit dialing is in effect. Calling to Antigua and Barbuda from NANP countries requires dialing the long-distance trunk prefix  1 before the area code and local telephone number.",
