Local calls within the BVI require seven digits, while calls from other NANP countries to the BVI use the dialing sequence  1 NPA-XXX-XXXX, with  1 being the NANP trunk access code.",

    "The  284 area code has been associated with a form of telephone fraud known as the 'one ring scam'. This scam involves the perpetrator calling the victim using a robodialer and hanging up when answered, hoping the victim will call back. If the victim does so, they are charged an automatic $19.95 international call fee plus $9.00 per minute thereafter."
