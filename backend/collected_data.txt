+7 is an ITU country code for telephone numbering. It was originally assigned to the Soviet Union. After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, the code continued to be used by the fifteen successor states, the majority of whom switched to own country codes from the +3xx and +9xx ranges between 1993 and 1998.
Currently, the +7 country code is only assigned by ITU to two countries: Kazakhstan and Russia.
Russia has allocated subsets of its national numbering range to Abkhazia and South Ossetia as well as to the captured territories of Ukraine (Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol), all of whom are reachable using +7.

Telephone area code of The Bahamas
Not to be confused with +242 country code for the Republic of the Congo.
Area code 242 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for The Bahamas. Area code 242 translates to the letter sequence BHA on an alpha-numeric keypad. The numbering plan area (NPA) was created in a split of area code 809, which was originally assigned to the Bahamas and many of the Caribbean islands. A permissive dialing period was in effect from October 1, 1996, to March 31, 1997.
When in The Bahamas, only the seven-digit number is required for local calls, but to call the Bahamas from other countries within the North American Numbering Plan, e.g., the United States, and Canada, the local number is prefixed with 1 and 242.

Barbados telephone area code
Not to be confused with 246 country code for the British Indian Ocean Territory (Diego Garcia).
13°10′12″N 59°33′09″W﻿ / ﻿13.17000°N 59.55250°W﻿ / 13.17000; -59.55250
Area code 246 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Barbados.[1]   The sequence 246 spells BIM on an alpha-numeric telephone keypad, a nickname for the island.[2]
Telecommunication services and telephone numbers in Barbados are administered by the Ministry of Finance, Investment, Telecommunications and Energy (MFIE) of the Government of Barbados.[3]
As a member of the North American Numbering Plan, Barbados uses telephone country code 1 for inbound routing of international calls. The telephone number format consists of the three-digit area code, the three-digit central office prefix and the local four-digit line or station number. Dialing procedures within the country and abroad comform to NANP standards.  Thus, Barbados telephone numbers are quoted per International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation  E.123 in the style +1 246 NXX-XXXX for international use.[4]


History[edit]
In 1958, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) assigned area code 809 for use by all affiliated telephone administrations in Bermuda and the Caribbean islands. Between 1995 and 1999, the numbering plan area was divided, and new area codes were assigned to individual administrations. Area code 246 was assigned to Barbados in 1995. The area code was in effect from 1 July 1996, and a permissive dialing period extended to 15 January 1997,[5] at which time all calls placed to Barbados required the new area code.

Dialing procedures[edit]
To Barbados[edit]
From within North America (NANP)
When calling Barbados from elsewhere in the North American Numbering Plan (e.g. from the United States or Canada), callers use ten-digit dialing after the long-distance trunk prefix 1. Thus callers dial 1 246 and the seven digit local telephone number.

From outside the NANP
When calling to Barbados from outside the NANP (e.g. from the United Kingdom), callers must dial the international dialling prefix followed by 1 to access the North American Numbering Plan. For example, a call placed from the United Kingdom is dialled as 00 1 246 NXX XXXX, where NXX XXXX is the local telephone number.

Within Barbados[edit]
When placing a call within Barbados, callers use seven-digit dialling (i.e. dialling the last seven digits of the national telephone number). Unlike in some other Caribbean islands, most residential landline subscribers have unlimited/un-metered rates for calling other local landlines.

To North America (NANP)
When calling to other places in the North American Numbering Plan, calls are dialed by ten-digit dialing in those countries. Callers dial 1 NPA NXX XXXX.
Though usually toll-free when dialled from the US, not all 1-800, 1-888, 1-877, or 1-866 are toll-free when being dialled from Barbados, and may be treated as a toll call.[citation needed]  If the number is not toll-free a recording gives directions for placing a fee based call.

To areas outside the NANP
When calling to areas outside the NANP (e.g. the United Kingdom), callers dial 011 + country code + telephone number. In the case of the UK, a user dials 011 44 + area code + telephone number.

Service codes[edit]
Police Force: 211, Ambulance: 511, Fire: 311
Information/Directory Assistance: 411
Operator: 0
Central office codes[edit]
In the NANP telephone format 1 NPA NXX XXXX, the central office codes fall in the position of NXX.  In 1996 the following central office numbering plan was established by the incumbent local exchange carrier.[5][6]

Telephone area code of Anguilla
Not to be confused with +264 country code for Namibia.
Area code 264 is the telephone area code of Anguilla in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).  The area code was created in a split of the original numbering plan area with area code 809. Permissive dialing started 31 March 1997 and ended on 30 September 1997. The area code is also represented on the telephone dial by the letter sequence ANG.
In Anguilla, a local telephone number is dialed using the seven digits of the directory number. Calls from other NANP countries, including the United States, require dialing 1 264 and the seven digit number.  Prior to the 1990s, subscribers in Anguilla dialed just three digits for a local call, and had the only four-digit national number in the 809 area code: 4972.[citation needed]

Designated telephone area code for Antigua and Barbuda in the NANP
Not to be confused with +268 country code for Swaziland.
Area code 268 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Antigua and Barbuda.
The area code digit sequence translates to ANT on a standard US alphanumeric telephone keypad, providing a mnemonic designation.
The area code was activated on 1 April 1996, the country's independence day, by division of numbering plan area 809 which used to comprise all Caribbean countries and Bermuda.[1] A permissive dialing period during which the old and the new area code could be used to call the new NPA was in effect for a period of one year until March 31, 1997. Foreign NPA calls to new telephone numbers in 268 required the new area code.[1]
For local calling in Antigua and Barbuda, seven-digit dialing is in effect. Calling to Antigua and Barbuda from NANP countries, such as the United States and Canada, requires dialing the long-distance trunk prefix 1 before the area code and local telephone number, which is the same calling procedure for calling from the country to other NANP countries. International dialing to other countries outside the NANP, requires the international dialing prefix 011 before country code and national telephone number.
Foreign NPA direct dialed toll calls must be prefixed by the digit 1 (1 + 10 digits) while operator-assisted calls require 0 (0 + 10 digits).

North American telephone area code for the British Virgin Islands
Area code 284 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the British Virgin Islands (BVI). The numbering plan area (NPA) was created in a split of area code 809 on 1 October 1997, when a permissive dialing period existed until 30 September 1998.
Within the British Virgin Islands, the seven digits are dialed for local calls. For calls from other NANP countries to the British Virgin Islands, the dialing sequence is 1 NPA-XXX-XXXX, where 1 is the NANP trunk access code.


One ring scam[edit]
The 284 area code has been linked to a form of telephone fraud known as the "one ring scam". The person perpetuating the scam calls the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes at odd hours of the night and then hangs up when the phone is answered, with the hope that the victim  will be curious enough to call the number back. When the victim does this, an automatic $19.95 international call fee is charged to their account as well as $9.00/min thereafter. Similar scams have been linked to Grenada (area code 473), Antigua (area code 268), Jamaica (area codes 876 and 658) and the Dominican Republic (area code 809).[1]

Telephone area code of the U.S. Virgin Islands
Area code 340 is the local telephone area code of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The 340 area code was created during a split from the original 809 area code, which began permissive dialing on 1 June 1997 and ended 30 June 1998.

Area code 345 is the local telephone area code of the Cayman Islands.  The 345 area code was created during a split from the original 809 area code which began permissive dialing on 1 September 1996 and ended 31 August 1997.
When in the Cayman Islands, the seven digits are used alone. When calling to Cayman Islands from anywhere in the United States or Canada  1(345) is dialed along with the other seven digits of the phone number.
Prior to splitting from 809, the Cayman Islands numbers all began with 94, and five-digit dialing was possible using only the digits that followed 94.

Telephone area code of Bermuda

Area code 441 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Bermuda. The numbering plan area  (NPA) was created on 1 October 1995 in a split of area code 809.


History[edit]
In 1958, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) assigned area code 809 for telephone communication services in Bermuda and the Caribbean islands.  Cuba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, and the French West Indies decided not to participate in the North American Numbering Plan. Beginning with Bermuda in November 1994, and The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Barbados in 1995, several countries in the Caribbean requested individual area code assignments from the NANPA, effectively splitting area code 809. The area code was retained only by the Dominican Republic,[1]
Bermuda requested its individual area code assignment on 16 November 1994.[2] A permissive dialing period in 441 commenced from 1 October 1995 until 30 September 1996.[3] When calling from countries and territories outside the North American Numbering Plan, the area code is prefixed by the international access code and the country code 1; for example from the United Kingdom, subscribers would dial 00 1 441.[4]

Area code for Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique
Area code 473 is the local telephone area code of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique.  The 473 area code, which spells GRE, was created during a split from the original 809 area code which began permissive dialing on 31 October 1997 and ended 31 October 1998.
For calls placed within Grenada, Carriacou or Petite Martinique, only the seven-digit local number is dialed. Calls to Grenada from anywhere in the United States or Canada are dialed 1 + 473 + seven-digit phone number.


Used in telephone fraud[edit]
The 473 area code has been linked to a form of telephone fraud known as the "one ring scam". The person perpetrating the scam calls the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes at odd hours of the night, then hangs up when the phone is answered with the hope that the victim will be curious enough to call the number back.[1] When the victim does this, an automatic $19.95 international call fee is charged to their account, as well as $9.00/min thereafter. Similar scams have been linked to Antigua (area code 268), Jamaica (area codes 876 and 658), the Dominican Republic (area code 809) and the British Virgin Islands (area code 284).[2]

Area code 649 is the local telephone area code of the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Area 649 was created in a split from the original area code 809.[1] It became effective 1 June 1997 and mandatory on 31 May 1998.[2]
Calls within the Turks and Caicos Islands are dialled with seven digits.  Calls to the Turks and Caicos Islands from within the North American Numbering Plan (which includes the United States, Canada and a number of Caribbean islands) are dialed like any other long-distance call: 1 649 xxx xxxx.
From the 1980s to 1997, the islands had just 946, then later also 941, as exchange prefixes.

NANP area code for Montserrat
This article is about the North American Numbering Plan area code. For the Mexican area code, see Area code 664 (Mexico).
Area code 664 in a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean. The digits of the area code translate to MNI in the alphanumeric mapping on telephone dials.
The area code was created in a split of area code 809, with a permissive dialing period from 1 July 1996 to 1 June 1997.
A local call within Montserrat is dialed with seven digits. A call from another North American Numbering Plan country (such as the United States or Canada) requires dialing the long-distance access code (1), the NPA code, and the seven-digit telephone number.
At one time the small island of Montserrat used only four-digit telephone numbers internally, as the first three digits after the former 809 area code were the same for everyone (491). As of May 2011, Montserrat has seven-digit numbers beginning with 236, 349, 410, 411, 412, 413, 415, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 664, and 724.

Telephone area code for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
The area code 670 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). It was created with the start of permissive dialing on July 1, 1997.  With the end of permissive dialing on July 1, 1998, it replaced the previous International Telecommunication Union country code +670, which is now used by East Timor.


History[edit]
Although the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) became a commonwealth in 1978 and the United States assumed sovereignty in 1986, calling between the CNMI  and the rest of the United States remained an international call (011-670-xxx-xxxx). As international calling rates began to fall in the more competitive destination countries during the 1990s, it became a considerable financial burden for people calling between the U.S. Mainland and the CNMI.
After the CNMI was added to the North American Numbering Plan, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulated calls to and from the CNMI as "domestic", hence dramatically lowering the cost of these telephone calls. This change also opened up national toll-free numbers to callers from the CNMI, which became very popular with the advent of pre-paid phone cards.
However, since no mobile telephone carriers in the U.S. are present in the CNMI market, cellular calls to the CNMI are not necessarily considered "domestic" or within the definition of "nationwide long distance".

Cost of international calls[edit]
FCC's regulation of the CNMI as "domestic" has no legal effect for telephone carriers outside the United States, for whom the CNMI is often not a competitive destination. Therefore, calls from other countries inbound to the CNMI can still be relatively expensive, especially compared to outbound calls from the CNMI since the CNMI has access to most U.S. toll-free numbers.

Dialing[edit]
Within the islands, only the seven-digit phone number is necessary. When a person in the islands calls anywhere in the United States or Canada, he or she simply dials 1 and then the area code and phone number. For callers in the U.S. or Canada calling to the islands, one first dials 1-670, followed by the seven-digit phone number.

Telephone area code for Guam
The area code 671 is the local telephone area code of the United States territory of Guam. It was created with the beginning of permissive dialing on July 1, 1997, replacing Guam's previous International Telecommunication Union country code 671 at the end of permissive dialing on July 1, 1998.


Origins[edit]
Prior to 1997, callers from the rest of the United States had to dial '011-671' and then the seven-digit telephone number to reach Guam, similar to international calls. As international calling rates began to fall in the more competitive destination countries during the 1990s, it became a considerable financial burden for people on the United States mainland to place calls to the United States territory of Guam, especially for those who were stationed in United States military bases there.

Calling costs[edit]
After Guam was added to the North American Numbering Plan, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulated calls to and from Guam as "domestic", hence dramatically lowering the cost of these telephone calls. This change also opened up national toll-free numbers (as of April 2015, area codes 800, 888, 877, 866, 855 and 844) to callers from Guam, which became very popular with the advent of prepaid phone cards.
However, since no U.S. national mobile telephone carriers have a presence on Guam, cellular calls into Guam are not necessarily considered "domestic" or within the definition of "nationwide long distance".
The FCC's regulation of Guam as "domestic" has no legal effect for telephone carriers outside the United States, for whom Guam is often not a competitive destination. Therefore, calls from other countries inbound to Guam can still be relatively expensive, especially compared to outbound calls from Guam since Guam is now open to the U.S.-based phone card market through toll-free access.

Dialing[edit]
Prior to 2021, within Guam, only the seven-digit phone number was necessary. When a person in Guam calls anywhere in the United States or Canada, one simply dials "1" and then the area code and phone number. For callers in the U.S. or Canada calling to Guam, one first dials '1-671', followed by the seven-digit phone number.
On October 24, 2021, area code 671 was transitioned to ten-digit dialing, despite not being part of an overlay numbering plan, in which multiple area codes are assigned to a numbering plan area. The area code had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that still permitted seven-digit dialing.[1]

Prefixes[edit]
With a population of less than 200,000,[2] there is only a limited need for prefixes on Guam. Currently, less than 165 of the 800 possibilities are actually in use.
Here is a list of landline prefixes on Guam and their associated geographic locations:

3XX: U.S. Military
47X: Hagåtña, Agana Heights, Asan-Maina, Piti, Chalan-Pago-Ordot, Mongmong-Toto-Maite
56X: Agat, Santa Rita

73X: Mangilao, Barrigada

Area code 684 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for American Samoa. The numbering plan area comprises the seven islands of Tutuila, Aunuʻu, Ofu, Olosega, Taʻū, Swains Island, and Rose Atoll.


History[edit]
Previous to joining the North American Numbering Plan, American Samoa used the ITU country code 684. It became the only area south of the equator that is part of the NANP.
The entry of American Samoa into the North American Numbering Plan was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 24, 2002.[1] Area code 684 was assigned on January 24, 2003.  The area code was installed on October 2, 2004, when a six-month permissive dialing period started, and central office code were available for order. When the area code was installed, American Samoa had one rater center, and ten central offices. All calls within the numbering plan area are local calls, dialed with seven digits, or with the prefix 0 and the area code. The long-distance access code is 1.

NANP area code for the country of St. Maarten (Caribbean)
Area code 721 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Sint Maarten, a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean. The area code was assigned in 2011 after membership of the country in the NANP became effective. International dialing to the country requires the use of country code 1.


History[edit]
Sint Maarten became a NANP member on 30 September  2011, after having been approved for membership in 2009. Previously, Sint Maarten used the country code 599, originally assigned to the now-dissolved Netherlands Antilles, and still in use by Curaçao and the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba). The northern French side of the island, known as Saint-Martin, does not use the North American Numbering Plan, and has the country code +590, shared with Guadeloupe and Saint Barthélemy. Calls between the two parts of the island require international calling procedures.
On July 27, 2011, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA) granted the issuance of the area code to Sint Maarten.[1] Implementation dates were set for September 30, 2011, when a permissive dialing period commenced until September 30, 2012, during which calls to the country were possible using country code 599 or the new NANP prefix 1-721.[1][2]

Calling procedure[edit]
Callers from outside the NANP, including callers from the French side of the island, must dial the international access code (often 00) followed by 1 721. Callers within the NANP dial 1 721 and the seven-digit local telephone number. Call within the country are established with seven-digit dialing of the local telephone number.

Previous country code[edit]
After St. Maarten's migration to the NANP, the remaining territories of the former Netherlands Antilles (Curaçao and the Caribbean Netherlands) have retained country code 599.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was the last location to break off from area code 809 during the 1995-1999 time period, when all of the various Caribbean and Atlantic geographic islands of the North American Numbering Plan which shared the 809 area code, broke off into their own unique new area codes, ultimately leaving the Dominican Republic as the sole entity retaining the 809 area code by June 1999.
When in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, dial the local seven digit phone number alone.
When calling to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from anywhere in the United States, Canada, and most other Caribbean islands of the North American Numbering Plan, dial 1 + 784 + the local seven digit phone number.

Telephone area code for Hawaii

Area code 808 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the Hawaiian Islands, comprising the windward and the leeward islands. The area code also serves Wake Island in the western Pacific Ocean. The code was assigned on August 8, 1957,[citation needed] about two years before the statehood of Hawaii.
Slightly over 1.4 million people live in Hawaii. Despite the state's rapid growth, and the proliferation of mobile numbers (particularly in Oahu, which includes Honolulu), a single area code is projected to be enough to serve the state until at least the third quarter of 2035.[1]
Prior to October 2021, area code 808 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated as a nationwide three-digit dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. This created a conflict for Hawaii's exchanges, all of which permitted seven-digit dialing. Therefore, area code 808 transitioned to ten-digit dialing on October 24, 2021.[2]
Marcus Mariota, quarterback for the Las Vegas Raiders football team and 2014 Heisman Trophy winner, had a special face mask honoring the 808 area code while playing with the University of Oregon.[3]
The 808 area code is sometimes used by telephone scammers with the intent of confusing the receiver of the call into thinking that it is an 800 area code due to their similar appearance.[4]

Trinidad & Tobago's telephone area code under the North American Numbering Plan

The area code 868 is assigned to Trinidad and Tobago, a member of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). The telephone numbering plan for the country is known as the National Numbering Plan.[1] It is part of a system used for assigning telephone numbers in Trinidad and Tobago, and functions as a part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).  It is regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, which holds responsibility for telecommunications in the country.[2]
Due to a long established affiliation with NANP,[3] phone numbers in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago are often styled as "(868) NXX-xxxx". However, the International Telecommunications Union's standards such as E.164[4] and E.123 both strongly advocate the inclusion of a "+1" prefix to indicate "868" is a part of the NANP.[5]


History[edit]
Area code 868 ("TNT") was created during a split from the original Area code 809 with permissive dialing beginning 1 June 1997.[6] 
With the end of permissive dialing on 31 May 1998, all calls placed to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago required the use of the +1 868 prefix.[6] The local telephone regulator proposed the area code 868, which corresponds to "TNT"—an abbreviation for Trinidad and Tobago—to reflect the nation's identity within the NANP.  

Dialing to Trinidad and Tobago[edit]
From within North America (NANP)
When calling Trinidad and Tobago from elsewhere in the North American Numbering Plan (e.g., from the United States or Canada), callers dial as if undertaking regular ten-digit dialing within those countries. Callers must simply dial 1 + 868 + seven digit phone number.

From outside NANP
When calling to Trinidad and Tobago from outside the NANP (e.g., from the United Kingdom), callers must dial their international dialing prefix followed by 1 to access the North American Numbering Plan.  For example, a call placed from the United Kingdom would be dialled as 00 + 1 + 868 + local seven digit phone number.

Dialing within Trinidad and Tobago[edit]
When placing a phone call from Trinidad and Tobago, also known as HNPA (home numbering plan area) dialing, callers simply use seven-digit dialing (i.e. dialing the last seven digits of the phone number).

To North America (NANP)
When calling other places in the North American Numbering Plan, callers dial as if undertaking regular ten-digit dialing in those countries. Callers dial 1 + NPA area code + seven digit phone number.
Though usually toll-free when dialed from the US, not all 1-800 phone numbers are toll-free when dialed from Trinidad and Tobago, and may be treated as a toll call.

To areas outside the NANP
When calling to areas outside the NANP (e.g., the United Kingdom), callers dial 011 + country calling code + phone number. In the case of the UK, a user would dial 011 + 44 + UK phone number.

Area code 869 is the local telephone area code of Saint Kitts and Nevis. The 869 area code was created during a split from the original (809) area code which began permissive dialing on 1 October 1996 and ended 31 March 1997.
When in Saint Kitts and Nevis, only seven-digit dialing is needed. When calling to Saint Kitts and Nevis from anywhere in the United States or Canada 1 + (869) + the seven digits needs to be dialed, i.e. 1 + 869 555 1212.

(Redirected from Telephone numbers in the Dominican Republic)

Area codes 809, 829, and 849 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the Dominican Republic. As all NANP members, the Dominican Republic uses country code 1, and has similar dialing procedures for dialing the ten-digit national telephone numbers, which consist of the area code, a three-digit central office code, and a four-digit line number. The three area codes of the country are organized as an overlay plan for a single numbering plan area (NPA), comprising the entire country. Thus, ten-digit dialing is mandatory.19°00′N 70°40′W﻿ / ﻿19.000°N 70.667°W﻿ / 19.000; -70.667


Area code 809[edit]
Area code 809 was assigned in 1958 to Bermuda and the Caribbean islands. However, Cuba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, and the French West Indies decided not to participate in the North American Numbering Plan. Beginning with Bermuda in November 1994, and The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Barbados in 1995, several countries in the Caribbean received individual area code assignments from the NANPA, effectively splitting area code 809. By 1999, it was retained only by the Dominican Republic,[1] following the departure of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from using the area code.[2]

Area codes 829 and 849[edit]
Area code 829 was added for all of the Dominican Republic to form an all-services distributed overlay on January 31, 2005. Earliest central office assignments were possible on October 1, 2005.[3] The relief was needed because of the growth of mobile phone communication in the Dominican Republic, starting in the mid-1990s with prepaid telephone cards, and growing quickly through the early 2000s with the launch of two cellphone carriers, Orange (now Altice) and Centennial (now Viva), in addition to the preexisting CODETEL (now Claro Dominicana) and TRICOM (now Altice Dominicana).
The expansion in telecommunication services continued and further relief for the numbering resources was needed in 2009, when an additional area code was assigned for the numbering plan area, area code 849.[4] Earliest central office code assignments were possibly on July 1, 2009, but did not occur until 2010.[5]

Calling scam[edit]
Telephone fraud scams once involved area code 809; it was being used since calling international numbers from the United States is charged at a higher rate than domestic calls.[6] The charge is set jointly by the originating and terminating countries; the foreign country portion of the charge could be very high, and was not regulated. There may have been a resurgence with wireless telephones.[6] The victim received a message on an answering machine to call a number with an 809 area code. However, the number dialed is an international call with a share of the revenue going from the foreign telephone company to the operator of the number. The victim could be put on hold indefinitely, and billed for each minute.
More recently, a similar scam has emerged due to the prevalence of wireless phones which display callback numbers automatically, known as the "one ring scam". The perpetrator of the scam calls the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes during night time, then hangs up after the call is answered with the hope that the receiver will be curious enough to call back, which incurs an automatic $19.95 international fee, as well as $9.00/min thereafter. Similar scams have been linked to Grenada (area code 473), Antigua (area code 268), Jamaica (area code 876) and the British Virgin Islands (area code 284).[7]

Telephone numbers in Jamaica
Jamaicaclass=notpageimage| NANP numbering plan area 876/658
Area codes 876 and 658 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Jamaica.
Having telephone service to the United States as early as 1936, it was not until 1962 that Jamaica had a high capacity link for dial service to the US network, which was operated as part of the NANP numbering plan area 809. 809 was designated for parts of the Caribbean region in 1958, and was divided in the 1990s for service to individual countries.  Area code 876 was created on 1 May 1997 for Jamaica.[1] In 2019, the numbering plan area received a second area code, 658, in formation of an overlay to relieve central office code exhaustion.
The telephone country code for reaching telephone numbers in the country is 1. From other NANP member regions, the dialing pattern is 1-658/876 NXX-XXXX, where 1 is the NANP long-distance trunk prefix.


History[edit]
In 1936, AT&T installed the first telephone service extensions to Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and El Salvador in the Caribbean.[2]
In 1958, Bermuda and the Caribbean Islands were designated as a large numbering plan area (NPA) with area code 809 as part of a comprehensive North American telephone numbering plan first defined in 1947 by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in cooperation with the independent telephone operators in the United States and Canada.
It was not until 1962 that a large capacity underseas telephone cable was installed between Jamaica and the United States for dial service.[2] For over three decades, Jamaica participated in the North American numbering system with a set of three-digit central office codes that had the digit 9 in the leading position, that where routed with area code 809.
In 1996, the Jamaican government requested and were granted by Bellcore, the NANP administration, the assignment of a new and separate area code for the country. Area code 876 was created on 1 May 1997, by a split of NPA 809.[1] In the process area code 809 was removed from the country and existing central office codes were reassigned with the new area code. A permissive dialing period during which central office codes could be reached with either area code began on 1 May 1997 and ended 31 July 1998,[3] after being extended from 1 November 1997.
On 15 September 2016, the Office of Utilities Regulation had approved an area code overlay in relief of central office code exhaustion in the country. Area code 658 was scheduled for service on 30 November 2018. This was subsequently postponed until 30 April 2019. Ten-digit dialing was permissive from 31 May, becoming mandatory on 30 March 2019,[4] The first 658-numbers were not assigned until May 2023.[5]
The country’s has been served by two mobile operators – Cable & Wireless/Liberty Global (marketed as FLOW Jamaica) and Digicel. The country's main landline provider is FLOW, as well as other smaller landline players like Digicel.

Fraud[edit]
The 876 area code was linked to a form of telephone fraud known as the "one ring scam". The person perpetuating the scam called the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes at odd hours of the night, then hung up when the phone was answered with the hope that they would be curious enough to call the number back. When the victim did this, substantial international call charges could accrue. Similar scams have been linked to Grenada (area code 473), Antigua (268), the Dominican Republic (809, 829, and 849), and the British Virgin Islands (284).[6]
The telephone fraud in Jamaica is a primary topic of the episode "Jamaican Lottery Scam" of the television series American Greed.

(Redirected from +881)
The Global Mobile Satellite System (GMSS) consists of several satellite phone providers serving private customers. It can be compared to PLMN (wireless telephony carriers) and PSTN (traditional wire-based telephony).
As of 2023, ranges of numbers have been assigned to two GMSS carriers:

Iridium Satellite LLC
Globalstar
In 1996, the ITU introduced country code +881 for direct international dialing of phones on GMSS providers. (Inmarsat had already been allocated country code +870.) The next digit following the country code is allocated (two at a time) to a particular GMSS carrier:[1][2]

Iridium

Satellite numbers outside the GMSS country code[edit]
Inmarsat is a satellite-based communications provider, but it is primarily a maritime service and is not generally considered part of the GMSS.
Globalstar usually allocates subscribers with a local number in the country they are based rather than using their GMSS country code.
Iridium also uses an Arizona-based access number to call Iridium phones for those unwilling or unable to call the usually expensive GMSS number directly.
Thuraya has been assigned +882-16, within the +882 range for International Networks.

Inmarsat is a British satellite telecommunications company, offering global mobile services. It provides telephone and data services to users worldwide, via portable or mobile terminals which communicate with ground stations through fifteen geostationary telecommunications satellites.[3]
Inmarsat's network provides communications services to a range of governments, aid agencies, media outlets and businesses (especially in the shipping, airline and mining industries) with a need to communicate in remote regions or where there is no reliable terrestrial network. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Connect Bidco, a consortium consisting of Apax Partners, Warburg Pincus, the CPP Investment Board and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, in December 2019.
On 8 November 2021, a deal was announced between Inmarsat's owners and Viasat, in which Viasat was to purchase Inmarsat. The acquisition was completed in May 2023.[4]


History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Further information: International Mobile Satellite Organization
The present company originates from the International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT), a non-profit intergovernmental organisation established in 1979 at the behest of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)—the United Nations maritime body—and pursuant to the Convention on the International Maritime Satellite Organization, signed by 28 countries in 1976.[5][6] The organisation was created to establish and operate a satellite communications network for the maritime community.[5][7] In coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization in the 1980s, the convention governing INMARSAT was amended to include improvements to aeronautical communications, notably for public safety.[5] The member states owned varying shares of the operational business.[6] The main offices were originally located in the Euston Tower, Euston Road, London.[8]

Privatization[edit]
In the mid-1990s, many member states were unwilling to invest in improvements to INMARSAT's network, especially owing to the competitive nature of the satellite communications industry, while many recognised the need to maintain the organisation's older systems and the need for an intergovernmental organisation to oversee public safety aspects of satellite communication networks.[6] In 1998, an agreement was reached to modify INMARSAT's mission as an intergovernmental organisation and separate and privatise the organisation's operational business, with public safety obligations attached to the sale.[6]
In April 1999, INMARSAT was succeeded by the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) as an intergovernmental regulatory body for satellite communications, while INMARSAT's operational unit was separated and became the UK-based company Inmarsat Ltd.[5][9] The IMSO and Inmarsat Ltd. signed an agreement imposing public safety obligations on the new company.[5] Inmarsat was the first international satellite organisation that was privatised.[6]
In 2005, Apax Partners and Permira bought shares in the company. The company was also first listed on the London Stock Exchange in that year.[10] In March 2008, it was disclosed that U.S. hedge fund Harbinger Capital owned 28% of the company.[11] In 2009, Inmarsat completed the acquisition of satellite communications provider Stratos Global Corporation (Stratos)[12] and acquired a 19-per cent stake in SkyWave Mobile Communications Inc., a provider of Inmarsat D+/IsatM2M network services which in turn purchased the GlobalWave business from TransCore.[13] Inmarsat won the 2010 MacRobert Award for its Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) service.[14][15]
Inmarsat at first provided services using Marisat[16] and MARECS,[17] which were launched by the US Navy and ESA respectively. In the early 1990s Inmarsat launched its first dedicated satellite constellation, Inmarsat-2. These satellites provided the Inmarsat-A service for maritime uses.[18] Between 1996 and 1998 Inmarsat's second constellation, Inmarsat-3, was launched.  Consisting of five geostationary L-band satellites the constellation provides the Inmarsat-B and Inmarsat-C services, primarily providing low bandwidth communications and safety services for global shipping.[19] Following privatisation in 1999 Inmarsat developed and launched the first satellite communications system offering global coverage, BGAN.[20] This service was provided initially through the three Inmarsat-4 satellite launched between 2005 and 2008, and was then extended with the addition of Alphasat in 2013.[21] In the 2010s, Inmarsat began development of the High Throughput Satellite (HTS) constellation Global Xpress, operating in the Ka-band portion of the spectrum. Global Xpress, launched in 2015, offers global satellite capacity to various markets including shipping and aviation. Global Xpress also marks a significant expansion of Inmarsat's commercial operations in the aviation markets.[22][23] In 2017, Inmarsat launched its first S-band satellite, intended to provide (in association with an LTE ground network) inflight internet access across Europe.[24] In March 2018, Inmarsat partnered with Isotropic Systems to develop a state-of-the-art, all electronic scanning antenna intended to be used with the Global Xpress network.[25]
On 20 September 2018, Inmarsat announced its strategic collaboration with Panasonic Avionics Corporation for an initial ten-year period, to provide in-flight broadband for commercial airlines. Inmarsat will be the exclusive provider of Panasonic for connectivity using the Ka-band satellite signal.[26] Inmarsat will now be offering Panasonic's portfolio of services to its commercial aviation customers.[27]

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370[edit]
Further information: Analysis of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 satellite communications
In March 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 passengers and crew en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. After turning away from its planned path and disappearing from radar coverage, the aircraft's satellite data unit remained in contact with Inmarsat's ground station in Perth via the IOR satellite (Indian Ocean Region, 64° East). The aircraft used Inmarsat's Classic Aero satellite phone service. Analysis of these communications by Inmarsat and independently by other agencies determined that the aircraft flew into the southern Indian Ocean and was used to guide the search for the aircraft.[28][29]

Takeover by Connect Bidco and privatisation[edit]
In March 2019 the company's board agreed to recommend a takeover offer of US$3.4 billion from Connect Bidco, a consortium consisting of Apax Partners, Warburg Pincus, the CPP Investment Board and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.[30] On 9 October 2019, Bloomberg reported that the UK government was set to approve the takeover with the final consultation for the deal set to conclude on 24 October 2019.[31] In November 2019, Inmarsat rejected an eleventh-hour effort to derail the US$6 billion sale, in which it was accused of ignoring a potential boost to the company's value. Oaktree argued that the recommended offer for Inmarsat failed to take account of the potential value of spectrum assets used by Inmarsat's U.S. partner Ligado.[32] Inmarsat delisted from London Stock Exchange, as the private equity funds took control of the company, on 5 December 2019; at the time, Inmarsat was operating 14 geostationary communications satellites.[33][34]

Acquisition by Viasat[edit]
On 8 November 2021, a $7.3bn deal was announced between Inmarsat's owners, led by Apax and Warburg Pincus, and Viasat in which Viasat would purchase Inmarsat for $850m in cash, issuing approximately 46 million shares of Viasat stock and taking on $3.4bn in debt.[35] Viasat has promised to honour a pledge made by the previous owners, when it was taken private in 2019, that Inmarsat would remain a UK-based company, and for other planned investments.[36]
Provisional approval for the merger was given by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority in March 2023[37] with 25 May 2023 set as the date for a formal decision.[38] On 31 May 2023, the acquisition was closed.[39][40]

Operations[edit]
The Inmarsat head office is at Old Street Roundabout in the London Borough of Islington.[41] Aside from its commercial services, Inmarsat provides Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to ships and aircraft at no charge, as a public service.[42]
Services include traditional voice calls, low-level data tracking systems, and high-speed Internet and other data services as well as distress and safety services. The Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) network provides General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) - type services at up to 800 kbit/s at a latency of 900-1100 ms[43] via an Internet Protocol (IP) satellite modem the size of a notebook computer,[44] while the Global Xpress network offers up to 50 Mbit/s at a latency of 700 ms[45] via antennas as small as 60 cm.[46] Other services provide mobile Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services used by the media for live reporting on world events via videophone,[47] and inflight Internet access via the European Aviation Network.[24]
The price of a call via Inmarsat has now dropped to a level where they are comparable to, and in many cases lower than, international roaming costs, or hotel phone calls. Voice call charges are the same for any location in the world where the service is used. Tariffs for calls to Inmarsat country codes vary, depending on the country in which they are placed. Inmarsat primarily uses country code 870 (see below).[48] Newer Inmarsat services use an IP technology that features an always-on capability where the users are only charged for the amount of data they send and receive, rather than the length of time they are connected.[49] In addition to its own satellites, Inmarsat has a collaboration agreement with ACeS regarding handheld voice services.[50]

Coverage[edit]
Inmarsat Global HQ at 99 City Road, London. (January 2006)
There are three types of coverage related to each Inmarsat I-4 satellite.[51]

Global beam coverage[edit]
Each satellite is equipped with a single global beam that covers up to one-third of the Earth's surface, apart from the poles. Overall, global beam coverage extends from latitudes of −82 to +82° regardless of longitude.

Regional spot beam coverage[edit]
Each regional beam covers a fraction of the area covered by a global beam, but collectively all of the regional beams offer virtually the same coverage as the global beams. Use of regional beams allow user terminals (also called mobile earth stations) to operate with significantly smaller antennas. Regional beams were introduced with the I-3 satellites. Each I-3 satellite provides four to six spot beams; each I-4 satellite provides 19 regional beams.

Narrow spot beam coverage[edit]
Narrow beams are offered by the three Inmarsat-4 satellites. Narrow beams vary in size, tend to be several hundred kilometres across. The narrow beams, while much smaller than the global or regional beams, are far more numerous and hence offer the same global coverage. Narrow spot beams allow yet smaller antennas and much higher data rates. They form the backbone of Inmarsat's handheld (GSPS) and broadband services (BGAN). This coverage was introduced with the I-4 satellites. Each I-4 satellite provides around 200 narrow spot beams.

Global Xpress (I-5)[edit]
The Inmarsat I-5 satellites provide global coverage using four geostationary satellites.[52] Each satellite supports 89 beams, giving a total coverage of approximately one-third of the Earth's surface per satellite. In addition, 6 steerable beams are available per satellite, which may be moved to provide higher capacity to selected locations.[53]
On 26 November 2019, the first satellite to extend the original 4 satellite first generation Global Xpress constellation was launched from Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) by an Ariane 5 launch vehicle.[54]

Country codes[edit]
The permanent telephone country code for calling Inmarsat destinations is:[48]

870 SNAC (Single Network Access Code)
The 870 number is an automatic locator; it is not necessary to know to which satellite the destination Inmarsat terminal is logged-in. SNAC is now usable by all Inmarsat services.
Country codes phased out on 31 December 2008 were

871 Atlantic Ocean Region – East (AOR-E)
872 Pacific Ocean Region (POR)
873 Indian Ocean Region (IOR)
874 Atlantic Ocean Region – West (AOR-W)
Since 18 July 2017, Inmarsat users using the service provided by China Transport Telecommunication & Information Center may apply for 11 digits Chinese mobile phone numbers starting with 1749. An international call function is not required when making phone calls to such numbers from Mainland China.[72]

Networks[edit]
Inmarsat-3 satellite locations
Inmarsat networks provide existing, evolved, and advanced services.  Existing and evolved services are offered through land Earth stations which are not owned nor operated by Inmarsat, but through companies which have a commercial agreement with Inmarsat. Advanced services are provided via distribution partners but the satellite gateways are owned and operated by Inmarsat directly.

High Throughput Services[edit]
Global Xpress: Since 2015, Inmarsat has offered high throughput services through the Global Xpress network. This service provides an IP based global service of up to 50 Mbit/s downlink and 5 Mbit/s uplink at a latency of 700 ms.[45] Services are provided for maritime, aviation, government and enterprise markets.[73] Global Xpress is supported by the existing BGAN L-band network, and services are offered using a combination of the two networks to increase availability and reliability.[74] In March 2018, Inmarsat partnered with Isotropic Systems to develop all-electronic scanning antenna intended to be used with the Global Xpress network.[25]
European Aviation Network: Inmarsat offers aviation services through the European Aviation Network, developed in partnership with Deutsche Telekom. The European Aviation Network uses a ground-based LTE network and an Inmarsat S-band satellite to provide 50Gbit/s capacity to aircraft in European airspace. The project faced a number of legal and regulatory challenges.[75] In October 2017, Inmarsat stated that commercial service would begin in 2018.[76] Construction of the ground network was completed in February 2018,[77] and by mid-2019 the service was offered on over 100 routes from key destinations such as London, Madrid, Barcelona, Athens, Lisbon, Prague, Rome and Vienna.[78] As of early 2021, the service has been used on 200,000 flights throughout Europe on flights on 250 aircraft operated by British Airways, Iberia and Vueling.[79]
Advanced services[edit]
The "BGAN Family" is a set of IP-based shared-carrier services:[80]

BGAN: Broadband Global Area Network for use on land. BGAN uses the I-4 satellites to offer a shared-channel IP packet-switched service of up to 800 kbit/s (uplink and downlink speeds may differ and depend on terminal model) and a streaming-IP service from 32 kbit/s up to X-Stream data rate (services depend on terminal model). Most terminals also offer circuit-switched Mobile Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services at 64 kbit/s and even low speed (4.8 kbit/s) voice etc. services. BGAN service is available globally on all I4 satellites.
FleetBroadband (FB): A maritime service, FleetBroadband is based on BGAN technology, offering similar services and using the same infrastructure as BGAN. A range of Fleet Broadband user terminals are available, designed for ships.
SwiftBroadband (SB): An aeronautical service, SwiftBroadband is based on BGAN technology and offers similar services. SB terminals are designed for commercial, private, and military aircraft.
M2M communications[edit]
The "BGAN M2M Family" is a set of IP-based services designed for long-term machine-to-machine management of fixed assets:[81]

BGAN M2M: launched in January 2012, is a global, IP-based low-data rate service, designed for high data availability and performance in permanently unmanned environments. With high-frequency, very low-latency data reporting, BGAN M2M is intended for monitoring fixed assets such as pipelines and oil well heads, or backhauling electricity consumption data within a utility.
IsatM2M: IsatM2M is a global, short burst data, store and forward service intended to deliver messages of 10.5 or 25.5 bytes in the send direction, and 100 bytes in the receive direction. The service is delivered to market via SkyWave Mobile Communications and Honeywell Global Tracking.
IsatData Pro: IsatData Pro is a global satellite data service designed for two-way text and data communications to remote assets with message size to mobile: 10 kBytes / from mobile: 6.4 kBytes with typical delivery time of 15 seconds. This service is intended for mission-critical applications for managing trucks, fishing vessels and oil and gas and heavy equipment, text message remote workers and security applications. It is provided by SkyWave Mobile Communications Inc, part of Orbcomm.
Global voice services[edit]
The company offers portable and fixed phone services:[82]

IsatPhone 2: IsatPhone 2 is a mobile satellite phone offering voice telephony. It has a variety of data capabilities, including SMS, short message emailing and GPS look-up-and-send, as well as supporting a data service of up to 20 kbit/s.[83]
IsatPhone Link: IsatPhone Link is a low-cost, fixed, global satellite phone service. It provides voice connectivity for those working or living in areas without cellular coverage and includes data capabilities.
FleetPhone: Inmarsat's FleetPhone service is a fixed phone service for use on smaller vessels where voice communications is the primary requirement or on vessels where additional voice lines are needed. It provides a low-cost, global satellite phone service option for those working or sailing outside cellular coverage.
Existing and evolved services[edit]
These are based on older technologies:[84]

Aeronautical (Classic Aero): provides analogue voice/fax/data services for aircraft. Three levels of terminals, Aero-L (Low Gain Antenna) primarily for packet data including ACARS and ADS, Aero-H (High Gain Antenna) for medium quality voice and fax/data at up to 9600 bit/s, and Aero-I (Intermediate Gain Antenna) for low quality voice and fax/data at up to 2400 bit/s. Note, there are also aircraft rated versions of Inmarsat-C and mini-M/M4. The aircraft version of GAN is called Swift 64 (see below).
Inmarsat-B: service was retired on 30 December 2016.[85] It provided digital voice services, telex services, medium speed fax/data services at 9.6 kbit/s and high speed data services at 56, 64 or 128 kbit/s. There was also a 'leased' mode for Inmarsat-B available on the spare Inmarsat satellites.
Inmarsat-C: this is effectively a "satellite telex" terminal with low-speed all-digital (transmission bit rate 1200 bit/s and information bit rate of 600 bit/s) store-and-forward, polling etc. capabilities. Certain models of Inmarsat-C terminals are approved for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) system, equipped with GPS.
Inmarsat-M: provides voice services at 4.8 kbit/s and medium speed fax/data services at 2.4 kbit/s. It paved the way towards Inmarsat-Mini-M. Service has ended.
Mini-M: provides voice services at 4.8 kbit/s and medium speed fax/data services at 2.4 kbit/s. One 2.4 kbit/s channel takes up 4.8 kbit/s on the satellite. Service was closed early January 2017
GAN (Global Area Network): provides a selection of low speed services like voice at 4.8 kbit/s, fax and data at 2.4 kbit/s, ISDN like services at 64 kbit/s (called Mobile ISDN) and shared-channel IP packet-switched data services at 64 kbit/s (called Mobile Packet Data Service or MPDS, formerly Inmarsat Packet Data Service – IPDS). GAN is also known as "M4". Service was closed early in January 2017.
Fleet: a family of networks that includes the Inmarsat-Fleet77, Inmarsat-Fleet55 and Inmarsat-Fleet33 members (The numbers 77, 55 and 33 come from the diameter of the antenna in centimetres). Much like GAN, it provides a selection of low speed services like voice at 4.8 kbit/s, fax/data at 2.4 kbit/s, medium speed services like fax/data at 9.6 kbit/s, ISDN like services at 64 kbit/s (called Mobile ISDN) and shared-channel IP packet-switched data services at 64 kbit/s (called Mobile Packet Data Service or MPDS - see below). However, not all services are available with all members of the family. The latest service to be supported is Mobile ISDN at 128 kbit/s on Inmarsat-Fleet77 terminals.
Swift 64:  Similar to GAN, providing voice, low rate fax/data, 64kbit/s ISDN, and MPDS services, for private, business, and commercial aircraft. Swift 64 is often sold in a multi-channel version, to support several times 64kbit/s.
Inmarsat D/D+/IsatM2M: Inmarsat's pager, although much larger than terrestrial versions. Some units are equipped with GPS. The original Inmarsat-D terminals were one-way (to mobile) pagers. The newer Inmarsat-D+ terminals are the equivalent of a two-way pager. The main use of this technology nowadays is in tracking trucks and buoys and SCADA applications.
MPDS (Mobile Packet Data Service):  Previously known as IPDS, this is an IP-based data service in which several users share a 64kbit/s carrier in a manner similar to ADSL. MPDS-specific terminals are not sold; rather, this is a service which comes with most terminals that are designed for GAN, Fleet, and Swift64.
IsatPhone: provides voice services at 4.8 kbit/s and medium speed fax/data services at 2.4 kbit/s. This service emerged from a collaboration agreement with ACeS, and is available in the EMEA and APAC satellite regions. Coverage is available in Africa, the Middle-East, Asia and Europe, as well as in maritime areas of the EMEA and APAC coverage.
Projects since 2008[edit]
European Aviation Network[edit]
On 30 June 2008, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the European's Decision to establish a single selection and authorisation process (ESAP – European S-band Application Process) to ensure a coordinated introduction of mobile satellite services (MSS) in Europe. The late 2008 selection process attracted four applications by prospective operators (ICO Global Communications (ICO), Inmarsat, Solaris Mobile (EchoStar Mobile), and TerreStar).[86][87]
In May 2009, the European Commission selected two operators, Inmarsat Ventures and Solaris Mobile, giving these operators "the right to use the specific radio frequencies identified in the Commission's decision and the right to operate their respective mobile satellite systems". EU Member States now have to ensure that the two operators have the right to use the specific radio frequencies identified in the commission's decision and the right to operate their respective mobile satellite systems for 18 years from the selection decision. The operators are compelled to start operations within 24 months (May 2011) from the selection decision.[88][89][90][91]
Inmarsat's S-band satellite programme provides mobile multimedia broadcast, mobile two-way broadband telecommunications and next-generation MSS services across all member states of the European Union and as far east as Moscow and Ankara by means of a hybrid satellite/terrestrial network. It was built by Thales Alenia Space and launched in 2017.[92] The complementary ground network consists of around 300 LTE base stations constructed by Deutsche Telekom.[93]
The European Aviation Network faced legal challenges as of 2018[update], including one from Viasat alleging unfair bidding practices and a misuse of spectrum[94] and a ruling by the Belgian telecommunications regulator revoking permission for the use of the ground network in Belgium.[95]

Global Xpress Expansion[edit]
Inmarsat ordered a fifth Global Xpress satellite from Thales Group. The satellite launched 26 November 2019 from Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) aboard an Ariane 5 launch vehicle.[54] The satellite has been described as a 'very high throughput satellite', and provides services to the Middle East, India and Europe.[96] former CEO Rupert Pearce (new CEO Rajeev Suri) indicated that Inmarsat planned further expansion of the Global Xpress network. Trials of new technologies demonstrated bandwidths of 330 Mbit/s over the existing Global Xpress network, far in excess of the existing 50 Mbit/s.[97]

Polar Coverage
To provide GX coverage to the users in the Arctic region, Inmarsat plans to improve GlobalXpress connectivity to above 65° North.[61]
Two high-capacity, multi-beam payloads GX-10A and GX-10B were planned in Highly elliptical orbits (HEO) for reliable coverage. Inmarsat worked in partnership with Space Norway HEOSAT in the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission. The satellites carrying the Inmarsat payload were to be manufactured by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems (NGIS). Launch for GX-10A and 10B was scheduled for 2022.[98]

Inmarsat-6[edit]
At the end of 2015, Inmarsat ordered two sixth generation satellites from Airbus. These satellites planned to offer both Ka- and L-band payloads and additional capacity to the existing BGAN and Global Xpress networks.[99] In 2017, it was announced that the first of these satellites would be launched by MHI in December 2021.[100] The first of the two satellites, Inmarsat-6 F1, was successfully launched on 22 December 2021 on a H-IIA rocket.[101] The second satellite was launched on 18 February 2023 on a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket, but suffered a power system failure in orbit that prevented it from becoming operational.[102]

Inmarsat-8[edit]
In May 2023, Inmarsat ordered three eighth-generation satellites from Swissto12, which will be based on their HummingSat satellite platform.[103]

IRIS and ICE[edit]
Inmarsat is participating in two ESA ARTES programs, IRIS and ICE:

IRIS is a project to improve tracking of aircraft, and to improve communications between aircraft and air traffic controllers. Inmarsat will provide high capacity satellite communications links for aircraft, and improve detection of aircraft locations in time and space.[104][105]
ICE (Inmarsat Communications Evolution) is a partnership with industrial partners intended to identify innovative technologies that can expand and enhance the capabilities of the next generation of satellite communications.[106]
Issues[edit]
INMARSAT and Iridium frequency bands abut each other at 1626.5 MHz thus each satcom radio has the ability to interfere with the other. Usually, the far more powerful INMARSAT radio disrupts the Iridium radio up to 10–800 m (33–2,625 ft) away.[107]

(Redirected from +882)
+882 and +883, non-country-specific calling codes
International Networks is the name given by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to country calling codes +882 and +883, and serves as a catch-all for telephone services not dedicated to a single country. Satellite telephone carriers, especially those with worldwide service, are allocated within the Global Mobile Satellite System (GMSS), country code +881, with the exception of non-terrestrial Inmarsat, country code 870.
As in the other such shared country codes, carriers are allocated number space within this code space plus their identification code (two-digit number in 882 code space, three or four digit number in 883 code space). The phone number for a subscriber of such a service starts with +882/+883 followed by the carrier code.
The cost to call such a number can be high; for example in the British Telecom price list rates for various 882 and 883 numbers ranged from £0.60 to £4.50 per minute.[1]

International premium rate service (IPRS) refers to internationally available telephone-based premium services. It is analogous to "900" or "976" numbers in North America, which always incur a recipient-defined charge in excess of regular call charges. Internationally, this service has been allocated country code +979. IPRS numbers are known as UIPRNs.
The ITU recommendation for IPRS defines four charge categories, across which the +979 numbering space is divided:



Range

Charge band

Designation


+979 1
1
"High"


+979 3
2
"Medium"


+979 5
3
"Low"


+979 9
Special
"Special"

UIPRNs are only available to premium service providers who will provide their service to more than one country.
The format of the numbers will be 979 a bcdefghi, where the a digit, 1, 3, 5 or 9, will indicate the charging band, and the remaining digits will be the IPRS subscriber's number.  1, 3 and 5 indicate charge bands 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while 9 will indicate a special charge band.
The service is not yet known to be active[citation needed]. Once it is activated, it may not be available from every country[citation needed], even though there is minimal or no cost to the receiving customer, as interchange rates would need to be negotiated for countries to allow origination of calls.

Usage[edit]
IPRS phone numbers are used by the German malware manufacturer FinFisher for their Android Trojans.[1]

The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is a telephone numbering plan for twenty-five regions in twenty countries, primarily in North America and the Caribbean. This group is historically known as World Zone 1 and has the telephone country code 1. Some North American countries, most notably Mexico, do not participate with the NANP.
The concepts of the NANP were devised originally during the 1940s by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) for the Bell System and the independent telephone companies in North America in Operator Toll Dialing. The first task was to unify the diverse local telephone numbering plans that had been established during the preceding decades, with the goal to speed call completion times and decrease the costs for long-distance calling, by reducing manual labor by switchboard operators. Eventually, it prepared the continent for direct-dialing of long-distance calls by customers, first possible in 1951 and expanded across the nation during the decades following. AT&T continued to administer the continental numbering plan and the technical infrastructure until the end of the Bell System, when administration was delegated to the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), a service that has been procured from the private sector by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. Each participating country forms a regulatory authority that has plenary control of local numbering resources.[1] The FCC also serves as the U.S. regulator. Canadian numbering decisions are made by the Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium.[2]
The NANP divides the territories of its members into numbering plan areas (NPAs) which are encoded numerically with a three-digit telephone number prefix, commonly termed the area code.[3] Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit telephone number unique only within its respective numbering plan area. The telephone number consists of a three-digit central office (or exchange) code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The North American Numbering Plan conforms with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation E.164, which establishes an international numbering framework.[4]


History[edit]
Area code handbook issued by many telephone companies in 1962 to promote the newly introduced direct distance dialing.
From the Bell System's beginnings in 1876 and throughout the first part of the 20th century, telephone networks grew from essentially local or regional telephone systems. These systems expanded by increasing their subscriber bases, as well as increasing their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with tie trunks. It was the responsibility of each local administration to devise telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth.[5] As a result, the North American telephone service industry developed into an unorganized set of many differing local numbering systems. The diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for long-distance telephone communication. By the 1940s, the Bell System set out to unify the various existing numbering plans to provide a unified, systematic method for routing telephone calls across the nation and to provide efficient long-distance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators.
In October 1947, AT&T published a new nationwide numbering plan in coordination with the independent telephone operators. The plan divided most of North America into eighty-six numbering plan areas (NPAs). Each NPA was assigned a unique three-digit code, typically termed NPA code or simply area code. These codes were first used in Operator Toll Dialing by long-distance operators in establishing calls via trunks between toll offices. The goal of automatic service required additional technical advances in the latest generation of toll-switching systems, completed by the early 1950s, and installation of new toll-switching systems in most numbering plan areas. The first customer-dialed direct call using an area code was made on November 10, 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey, to Alameda, California.[6] Direct distance dialing (DDD) was introduced subsequently across the country. By the early 1960s, DDD had become commonplace in cities and most towns in the United States and Canada. By 1967, the number of assigned area codes had increased to 129.[7]
The status of the network of the 1960s was represented by a new name used for technical documentation: North American Integrated Network.[7] By 1975, the numbering plan was referred to as the North American Numbering Plan,[8] resulting in the well-known initialism NANP, as other countries sought or considered joining the standardization.

Foreign expansion[edit]
Although Bermuda and the Caribbean islands had been assigned the area code 809 as early as 1958 by the administrators at AT&T, individual participating countries or territories had no autonomy over their numbering plan as they received centrally assigned central office prefixes that needed to be unique from those of other countries with the same area code. Regions in Mexico with high call volumes to and from the US were assigned functional area codes as early as 1963, for the purpose of call routing, but a nationwide system of participation in the NANP eventually failed.
During the decades following, the NANP expanded to include all of the United States and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and seventeen nations of the Caribbean.[9][10]
At the request of the British Colonial Office, the numbering plan was first expanded to Bermuda and the British West Indies because of their historic telecommunications administration through Canada as parts of the British Empire and their continued associations with Canada, especially during the years of the telegraph and the All Red Line system.
Not all North American polities participate in the NANP. Exceptions include Mexico, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the Central American countries and some Caribbean countries (Cuba, Haiti, the French Caribbean and the Dutch Caribbean, except for Sint Maarten). The only Spanish-speaking state in the system is the Dominican Republic. Mexican participation was planned,[11] but implementation stopped after three area codes (706, 903 and 905) had been assigned, and Mexico opted for an international numbering format, using country code 52.[12] The area codes in use were subsequently withdrawn in 1991.
The Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten joined the NANP in September 2011, receiving area code 721.[13] Sint Maarten shares the island with the French Collectivity of Saint Martin which, like the rest of the French Caribbean, is not part of the NANP.

Administration[edit]
The NANP is administered by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA, formerly Administration).[14] This function is overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, which assumed the responsibility upon the end of the Bell System. The FCC solicits private sector contracts for the role of the administrator.
Before the division of the Bell System, administration of the North American Numbering Plan was performed by AT&T's Central Services Organization. In 1984, this function was transferred to Bell Communications Research (Bellcore), a company created by the divestiture mandate to perform services for the newly created local exchange carriers. On January 19, 1998, the NANPA function was transferred to the IMS division of Lockheed Martin in Washington, D.C.[15] In 1999, the contract was awarded to Neustar, a company created from Lockheed for this purpose. The contract was renewed in 2004, and again in 2012.[16] On January 1, 2019, Somos assumed the NANPA function with a one-year bridge contract granted by the FCC with the goal of consolidating the NANPA function with the Pooling Administrator and identifying a long-term contractor.[17][18] On December 1, 2020, Somos secured the $76 million contract for a term of eight years against one other bidder.[19]

Numbering plan[edit]
The long-range vision of the architects of the North American Numbering Plan was a system by which telephone subscribers in the United States and Canada could themselves dial and establish a telephone call to any other subscriber without the assistance of switchboard operators. While the dialing of telephone calls by subscribers was common-place in many cities across the continent for local destinations, long-distance telephone calls had to be patched through manually by telephone operators at typically multiple intermediate toll offices using a system known since 1929 as the General Toll Switching Plan.[20] The immediate goal for improvement in the time of call establishment was to provide technology for the originating toll operators to dial calls directly to the destination. This system was known as Operator Toll Dialing.[21]
Operator Toll Dialing required a nationwide telephone numbering plan that unified all local numbering plans into a consistent universal system. Local numbering plans, many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed, or even fewer in small communities, needed to be expanded. but the goal was to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems.

Numbering plan areas and central offices[edit]
The new numbering plan divided the North American continent into regional service areas, termed numbering plan areas (NPAs). The divisions conformed primarily to the jurisdictional boundaries of the U.S. states and the Canadian provinces.[22] Some states or provinces needed to be divided into multiple areas. NPAs were created in accordance with principles deemed to maximize customer understanding and minimize dialing effort, while reducing plant cost.[23] Each NPA was identified by a unique three-digit code number, termed the numbering plan area code, which was prefixed to the local telephone number when calling from one NPA to another. Calling within the same numbering plan area did not require dialing the area code.
The telephone exchanges—in the Bell System they were officially termed central offices—became local exchange points in the nationwide system. Each of them was also assigned a three-digit number unique within its NPA. The combination of NPA code and central office code served as a destination routing code for use by operators to reach any central office through the switching network.[22] Due to the numerical structure of the numbering system, each NPA was technically limited to 540 central offices.[23]
Although the limitation to 540 central offices required the most populous states to be divided into multiple NPAs, it was not the sole reason to subdivide a state. An important aspect was the existing infrastructure for call routing, which had developed during preceding decades, often independently of state boundaries. The rules of determining areas also attempted to avoid cutting across busy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an NPA, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area.[24][22] As a result, New York state was initially divided into five areas, the most of any state. Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas were assigned four NPAs each, and California, Iowa, and Michigan received three. Eight states and provinces were divided into two NPAs.
Traditionally, central office switching systems were designed to serve as many as ten thousand subscriber numbers. Thus, subscribers were assigned four-digit line or station numbers. This rounded the total number of digits in a subscriber telephone number to ten: a three-digit area code, three-digit central office code, and four digits for each line. This fixed format defined the North American Numbering Plan as a closed numbering plan,[25] as opposed to developments in other countries where the number of digits was not fixed.

Initial numbering system[edit]
In 1947, AT&T completed the new design for a nationwide toll network that established the original North American area codes. The new numbering plan provided for 152 area codes, each with a capacity to serve as many as 540 central offices.[26] Originally, only eighty-six area codes were assigned. New Jersey received the first NPA code in the new system, area code 201.[27] The second area code, 202, was assigned to the District of Columbia. The allocation of area codes was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas. For example, the Indiana numbering plan area 317 was divided to provide a larger numbering pool in the Indiana suburbs of Chicago (area code 219).
Initially, states divided into multiple numbering plan areas were assigned area codes with the digit 1 in the second position, while areas that comprised entire states or provinces received codes with 0 as the middle digit. This rule was violated by the early 1950s,[22] as NPAs with digit 0 in the middle had to be divided, but until 1995 all area codes assigned had none other than the digits 0 and 1 in this position.
The eight codes of the form N11 (N=2–9) were reserved as service codes. The easily recognizable codes of the form N00 were available in the numbering plan, but were not initially included in assignments.[7] Additional area code patterns were later assigned for other services; for example, the area codes N10 were implemented for the Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).[28]

Central office codes[edit]
It was already common practice for decades that the digits 0 and 1 could not appear in the first two digits of the central office codes, because the system of using the first two letters of familiar names for central offices did not assign letters to these digits. The digit 0 was used for operator assistance, and 1, which is essentially a single pulse of loop interruption, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time.[22] Therefore, the 0/1 rule for the area code provided a convenient means to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit dialing.
The use of telephone exchange names as part of telephone numbers had been a well-established practice, and this was preserved for convenience and expediency in the new network design. The letter-to-digit translations were printed on the face of every rotary dial in the metropolitan areas, according to a scheme designed by W.G. Blauvelt in 1917, that had been used in the Bell System in large metropolitan areas since the early 1920s.[29] The network reorganization standardized this system to using a two-letter, five-digit (2L-5N) representation of telephone numbers in most exchanges in North America,[30] or to using an equivalent all-numeric seven-digit numbering plans, as was practiced by some telephone companies.

Dialing procedures[edit]
The closed numbering plan did not require the subscriber to dial all digits. When making a local call or a call within the same numbering plan area, the area code was omitted in seven-digit dialing. In some cases, even fewer digits sufficed for local calling. Ten-digit dialing was only necessary when making foreign area calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area.[31] Exceptions existed for communities on NPA boundaries, so that uniform local dialing was still possible in historically established communities.

All-number calling was a telephone numbering plan introduced in 1958,[33] that converted telephone numbers with exchange names to a numeric representation of seven digits.
The original plan of 1947 had been projected to be usable beyond the year 2000. However, by the late 1950s it became apparent that it would be outgrown by about 1975.[34] The limitations for the usable leading digits of central office codes, imposed by using common names for central office names, and their leading two characters as guides for customer dialing could no longer be maintained when opening new central offices. By 1962 it was forecast that in 1985 the number of telephones in the nation would equal its population of 280 million and increase to 600 million telephones for 340 million people in 2000.[30] As a result, a few North American telephone administrations, notably New York Telephone Co., first introduced letter combinations that could not be associated with a familiar pronounceable central office name. Finally, they sought the elimination of central office names and letter codes, and introduced all-number calling (ANC).
With all-number calling, the number of permissible central office prefixes increased from 540 to potentially 800, but the first two digits of the central office code were still restricted to the range 2 to 9, and the eight combinations that ended in 11 were reserved as special calling codes.[30] This increased the numbering pool for central office codes to 640, and resulted in the partitioning of the prefix space (000—999).[32]

Interchangeable central office codes[edit]
As the numbering plan grew during the 1960s using all-number calling, plan administrators at AT&T identified that by c. 1973 some of the largest area codes in urban centers might run out of central office prefixes to install more individual access lines. For relief in these cases, they finally eliminated the requirement that the middle digit of the central office code could not be 0 or 1. This resulted in the format of interchangeable central office codes, N X X, where N=2–9 and X=0–9. The first cities that required this action, in 1974, were the cities of Los Angeles with area code 213 and New York with 212. This change also required modification of the local dialing procedures to distinguish local calls from long-distance calls with area codes.
Requiring 1 to be dialed before the full number in some areas provided for area codes of the form N10, such as 210 in the San Antonio, Texas, area and 410 in eastern Maryland. Therefore, someone calling from San Jose, California, to Los Angeles before the change would have dialed 213-555-0123 and after the change 1-213-555-0123, which permitted the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the San Jose area. The preceding 1 also ideally indicates a toll call; however, this is inconsistent across the NANP because the FCC has left it to the U.S. state public utilities commissions to regulate for traditional landlines, and it has since become moot for mobile phones and digital VoIP services that offer nationwide calling without the extra digit.[citation needed]

Interchangeable NPA codes[edit]
In 1995, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator eliminated the requirement that the middle digit of an area code had to be either 0 or 1, implementing fully interchangeable NPA and central office codes, that had already been anticipated since the 1960s, when interchangeable central office codes were sanctioned.

Modern plan[edit]
The NANP numbering format may be summarized in the ten-digit notation NXX NXX-XXXX, where N denotes any of the digits 2–9, and X denotes any digit 0–9.



Component

Name

Number ranges

Notes


NXXoften denoted NPA

Numbering plan area code

The first NXX block is the numbering plan area code. When the second and third digits are the same, the code is an easily recognizable code (ERC). ERCs designate special services; e.g., 800 for toll-free service. The NANP is not assigning area codes with 9 as the second digit.[35]

Covers Canada, the United States, parts of the Caribbean Sea, and some Atlantic and Pacific islands. The area code is often enclosed in parentheses.


NXX

Central office code

The second NXX block is the central office code. Permissible numbers exclude easily recognizable codes N11, used for special services.

Also called exchange code


XXXX

Line number

A unique four-digit number for each NPA, from 0000 to 9999

Also called station code

Using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or central office code is invalid, as is a 9 as the middle digit of an area code; these are trunk prefixes or reserved for North American Numbering Plan expansion.

For example, 234 235-5678 is a valid telephone number; with area code 234, central office prefix (exchange) 235, and line number 5678. The number 234 911-5678 is invalid, because the central office code must not be in the form N11. 394 259-2653 is invalid, because the NANP is not assigning area codes with 9 as the second digit. 314 159-2653 is invalid, because the office code must not begin with 1. 123 234-5678 is invalid, because the NPA must not begin with 0 or 1.[36][37][38][39]
Each three-digit area code has a capacity of 7,919,900 telephone numbers (7,918,900 in the United States).
Despite the widespread use of fictional telephone numbers of the form NXX 555-XXXX, only the block of line numbers from 0100 through 0199 are reserved specifically for this purpose, leaving the rest available for assignment.
The country code for all countries participating with the NANP is 1. The prefix digit 1 is also used within the NANP for long-distance dialing.

Telephone number formatting[edit]
NANP telephone numbers are usually rendered as NPA-NXX-XXXX or (NPA) NXX-XXXX . For example, 250 555 0199, a fictional number, could be rendered as 250-555-0199, (250) 555-0199, 250-5550199, or 250/555-0199.  The parentheses were originally used to indicate that the area code was not necessary for local dialing. The Government of Canada's Translation Bureau recommends using hyphens between groups; e.g. 250-555-0199.[40]
Using the global formatting for telephone numbers, per recommendation E.164 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a NANP number is rendered as +1NPANXXXXXX, without spaces or punctuation, e.g. +12505550199. The plus sign indicates that the user may have to dial another prefix per local dialing conventions in the country of origin that selects a trunk for international network access; the digits immediately following are thus the country code, where 1 is the NANP country code.

Non-geographic services[edit]
The North American Numbering Plan recognizes the need for non-geographic services by designating certain numbering blocks for such purposes. Many of these telephone numbers are selected from the easily recognizable codes (ERCs).
System-wide toll-free calling, for which the receiving party is billed for the call, uses the number range with area codes of the form 8XX.
Area code and central office prefixes for other non-geographic services have the form 5XX-NXX. As of January 2021, the codes 500, 521, 522, 533, 544, 566, 577, 588, 523, 524, 525, and 526 have been designated.[41] These codes are used for fixed or mobile devices, and not assigned to rate centers. As addresses, they may or may not traverse the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Applications include the use as personal 500 numbers.
Some carrier-specific services have used area code 700. In Canada, area code 600 is used for non-geographic applications. Area code 900 has been used for high-toll 900 numbers.

Cellular mobile services[edit]
The North American Numbering Plan does not reserve special non-geographic area codes exclusively for cellular phones, as is customary in some other national telephone administrations. Only one regional exception exists in area code 600 in Canada.
For cellular services, telephone numbers in the NANP are allocated within each area code from special central office prefixes. Calls to them are billed at the same rate as any other call. Consequently, the caller pays pricing model adopted in other countries, in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate, but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user, could not be implemented. Instead, North American cellular telephone subscribers are also generally charged for receiving calls (subscriber pays). In the past, this has discouraged mobile users from publishing mobile telephone numbers, but by the first decade of the 21st century, most users selected bundle pricing plans that included an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period, and most U.S. carriers since offer unlimited calling plans at mass-market prices.[42]
Industry observers have attributed the relatively low mobile phone penetration rate in the United States, compared to that of Europe, to the subscriber-pays model.[citation needed] In this model the convenience of the mobility is charged to the subscriber. Callers from outside the local-calling region of the assigned number, however, pay for a long-distance call, although domestic long-distance rates are generally lower than the rates in caller-pays systems. Conversely, an advantage of caller-pays is the relative absence of telemarketing and nuisance calls to mobile numbers. The integrated numbering plan also enables local number portability between fixed and wireless services within a region, allowing users to switch to mobile service while keeping their telephone number.
The initial plan for area code overlays did allow for providing separate area codes for use by mobile devices, although these were still assigned to a specific geographical area, and were charged at the same rate as other area codes. Initially, the area code 917 for New York City was specifically assigned for this purpose within the boroughs; however, a Federal court ended the practice and the use of an area code for a specific telephony purpose.[citation needed] Since mobile telephony has been expanding faster than landline use, new area codes typically have a disproportionately large fraction of mobile and nomadic numbers, although landline and other services rapidly follow and local network portability can blur these distinctions.

Growth[edit]

Canada and the United States have experienced rapid growth in the number of area codes, particularly between 1990 and 2005. The widespread adoption of fax, modem, and mobile phone communication, as well as the deregulation of local telecommunication services in the United States during the mid-1990s, increased the demand for telephone numbers.
The Federal Communications Commission allowed telecommunication companies to compete with the incumbent local exchange carriers for services, usually by forcing the existing sole service provider to lease infrastructure to other local providers. Because of the original design of the numbering plan and the telephone switching network that assumed only a single provider, number allocations had to be made in 10,000-number blocks even when many fewer numbers were required for each new vendor. Due to the proliferation of service providers in some numbering plan areas, many area codes were threatened with exhaustion of numbering resources. The number blocks of failed service providers often remained unused, as no regulatory mechanism existed to reclaim and reassign these numbers.
Area codes are added by two principal methods, number plan area splits and overlays. Splits were implemented by dividing an area into two or more regions, one of which retained the existing area code and the other areas receiving a new code. In an overlay, multiple codes are assigned to the same geographical area, obviating the need for renumbering of existing services. Subtle variations of these techniques have been used as well, such as dedicated overlays, in which the new code is reserved for a particular type of service, such as cellular phones and pagers, and concentrated overlays, in which a part of the area retained a single code while the rest of the region received an overlay code. The only service-specific overlay in the NANP was area code 917 (New York City) when it was first installed; such service-specific area code assignments were later prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission.
Most area codes of the form N10, originally reserved for AT&T's Teletypewriter eXchange (TWX) service, were transferred to Western Union in 1969 and were freed for other use in 1981 after conversion to Telex II service was complete. The last of these, 610, was assigned to Canada, but reassigned in 1992. These new area codes, as well as a few other codes used for routing calls to Mexico, were used for telephone area code splits during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as all other area codes using the original plan had been consumed.
After the remaining valid area codes were used up by expansion, in 1995 the rapid increase in the need for more area codes forced the NANPA to allow the digits 2 through 8 to be used as a middle digit in new area code assignments, with 9 being reserved as a last resort for potential future expansion. At the same time, local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit. The first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were area code 334 in Alabama and area code 360 in Washington, which both began service on January 15, 1995. This was followed quickly by area code 520 serving Arizona on March 19, 1995.
By 1995, many cities in the United States and Canada had more than one area code, either from dividing a city into different areas (NPA split) or having more than one code for the same area (NPA overlay). The overlay method requires that the area code must be dialed in all cases, even for local calls, while the split plan may permit seven-digit dialing within the same area. The transition to ten-digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase, which is widely publicized, during which dialing all ten digits is optional. After a period of several months, mandatory dialing begins, when seven-digit dialing is no longer permissible. Atlanta was the first U.S. city to require mandatory ten-digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area, coinciding roughly with the 1996 Summer Olympics held there. Atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size, but also because it had the world's largest fiber-optic network at the time, five times larger than that of New York, and it was home to BellSouth (now part of AT&T), then the Southeastern Regional Bell Operating Company, with AT&T's fiber optics manufacturing facility within the city.

Growth problems[edit]
Depending on the techniques used for area code and central office code relief, the effect on telephone users varies. In areas in which overlays were used, this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers, so existing directories, business records, letterheads, business cards, advertising, and "speed-dialing" settings can retain the same telephone numbers, while the overlay is used for new number allocations. The primary effect on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing ten-digit numbers when only seven-digit dialing was previously needed.
Dividing numbering plan areas instead of overlaying generally avoids the requirement for mandatory area code dialing within the new regions, but at the expense of having to convert a region to the new code, which necessitates updating records and directories to accommodate the new numbers. A transition period prior to splitting provides a period of "permissive dialing" during which seven-digit dialing is still permitted. Also, many splits involved significant technical issues, considering municipal boundaries and tributary trunking arrangements.
As an example, in 1998, the area code 612, assigned to the Minneapolis – Saint Paul Twin Cities, was divided to create area code 651 for St. Paul and the eastern metropolitan area. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission mandated that the new boundary exactly follow municipal boundaries, which were distinctly different from telephone exchange boundaries, and that all subscribers keep their seven-digit numbers. These two goals were directly at odds with the reason for the division, namely to provide additional telephone numbers. More than forty exchanges had territory that straddled the new boundary. As a result, prefixes were duplicated in both area codes, which counteracted much of the benefit of the division, with only 200 of 700 prefixes in area 612 transferring entirely to area 651. In less than two years, area code 612 again exhausted its supply of telephone numbers, and necessitated a three-way sivision in 2000, creating the new area codes 763 and 952. The division again followed political boundaries, rather than rate center boundaries, resulting in additional split prefixes; a few numbers were transferred from 612 to 651 to 763 in less than two years.

Decrease of growth rate[edit]
Recognizing that the proliferation of area codes was due largely to the telecom deregulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of ten thousand, the FCC instructed NANPA, by then administered by Neustar, to alleviate the numbering shortage. As a result, number pooling was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1,000 rather than 10,000. Because of the then design of the switched telephone network, this was a considerable technical obstacle. Number pooling was implemented with another technical obstacle, local number portability.
The program has been implemented in much of the United States by state regulators. Some cities have also implemented rate center consolidation; fewer rate centers resulted in more efficient use of telephone numbers, as carriers would reserve blocks of 1,000 or 10,000 numbers in each of multiple rate centers in the same area even if they had relatively few clients in the area.[43] (A rate center is a geographical area used by a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) to determine the boundaries for local calling, billing and assigning phone numbers. Typically a call within a rate center is local, while a call from one rate center to another is a long-distance call.) Together with aggressive reclamation of unused number blocks from telecom providers, number pooling has reduced the need for additional area codes, so that many previously designated area splits and overlays have been postponed indefinitely.
Canada never implemented number pooling, so that even the smallest villages are rate centers and every Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) is assigned blocks of ten thousand numbers.

New area codes outside the contiguous United States and Canada[edit]
Before 1995, all NANP countries and territories outside the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Canada shared the area code 809. This included Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each has since been assigned one or more distinct numbering plan areas; area code 809 exclusively serves the Dominican Republic (along with area codes 829 and 849). The United States Pacific territories of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam joined the NANP in 1997, and American Samoa became an NANP member in October 2004. The Dutch possession of Sint Maarten was originally scheduled to join the NANP on May 31, 2010, but the changeover was postponed to September 30, 2011.[13]

Telephone number length expansion[edit]
Main article: North American Numbering Plan expansion
The NANP exhaust analysis estimates that the existing numbering system is sufficient beyond 2049, based on the assumptions that a maximum of 674 NPAs continue to be available, and that on average 3,990 central office codes are needed per year.[44]
In case of exhaustion, various plans are discussed for expanding the numbering plan. One option is to add the digit 1 or 0 either at the beginning or at the end of the area code, or prefixing it to the seven-digit subscriber number. This would require eleven-digit dialing even for local calls between any two NANP numbers. Another proposal introduces the digit 9 into the area code in the format x9xx, so that, for example, San Francisco's 415 would become 4915. Other proposals include reallocating blocks of numbers assigned to smaller long-distance carriers or unused reserved services.[citation needed]

Dialing procedures[edit]
The structure of the North American Numbering Plan permits implementation of local dial plans in each plan area, depending on requirements. When multiple NPA codes serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes.[45] Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, it may be necessary to prefix a telephone number with 1. The NANPA publishes dial plan information for individual area codes.[46]
The standard dial plans in most cases:





Local within area code

Local outside area code

Toll within area code

Toll outside area code


Single code area, with toll alerting

7D or 10D

7D or 10D

1+10D

1+10D


Single code area, without toll alerting

7D or 10D

1+10D

7D or 10D

1+10D


Overlaid area, with toll alerting

10D

10D

1+10D

1+10D


Overlaid area, without toll alerting

10D

1+10D

10D

1+10D

The number of digits dialed is unrelated to being a local call or a toll call when there is no toll alerting. Allowing 7D local dialing across an area code boundary, which is rare today, requires central office code protection, locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides. Landlines occasionally require 1+10D where 10D is required, most notably in California.
Most areas permit local calls as 1+10D except for Texas, Georgia, and some jurisdictions in Canada which require that landline callers know which numbers are local and which are toll, dialing 10D for local calls and 1+10D for all toll calls.
In almost all cases, domestic operator-assisted calls are dialed 0+10D.

Special numbers and codes[edit]
See also: N11 code
Some common special numbers in the North American system:

0 — operator assistance
00 — long-distance operator assistance (formerly 2-1-1)
011 — access code for international direct dialing all destinations outside the NANP
01 — international access code using operator assistance for all destinations outside the NANP
101-xxxx — Carrier access code for selecting an alternative long-distance carrier; xxxx is the carrier identification code (CIC).
211 — local community information or social services (in some cities)
311 — city government or non-emergency police matters
411 — local telephone directory service; some telephone companies provide national directory assistance.
511 — traffic, road, and tourist information
611 — telephone line repair service (formerly 4104), wireless operator customer service (formerly 811)
711 — relay service for customers with hearing or speech disabilities
811 — local utility location services (United States), non-urgent telehealth/teletriage services in Canada (formerly telephone company business office)
911 — emergency telephone number — fire department, medical emergency, police
988 — suicide prevention helpline[47][48]
950-xxxx — Feature group code for access to a carrier from a non-subscriber location. The feature requires the customer dial a 950-xxxx number and enter a calling card number and destination telephone number. It was originally used for locations where 101-xxxx dialing was not possible.
958-xxxx (local); 959-xxxx (long distance) — Plant test numbers, such as automatic number announcement circuits. It was once common to reserve entire unused exchange prefixes or N11 numbers (4101 was ringback number on many step-by-step switches), but these have largely moved to individual unpublished numbers within the standard 958-xxxx (local) or 959-xxxx (long-distance) plant test exchanges as numbers become scarce.
1 (NPA) 555-1212 — non-local directory information (Canada and United States)
Vertical service codes are used for special calling features, such as:

*51 and 1151 — a history of unanswered calls on a telephone number, useful for those who are not Caller ID subscribers
*57 and 1157 — used to trace harassing, threatening, abusive, obscene, etc. phone calls, and keep results of trace at phone company
*66 and 1166 — to keep retrying a busy-line (see also Called-party camp-on)
*67 and 1167 — Caller ID Block
*69 and 1169 — Call Return (caller may press '1' to return call after hearing number)
*70 and 1170 — cancel call waiting on a call-by-call basis
*71 and 1171 — three-way calling, which lets a person talk to people in two different locations at the same time
*74 and 1174 — speed dial, which allows someone to quickly dial any of eight frequently called numbers using a one-digit code, from any phone on their line
*75 — allows a total of 30 speed-call numbers with two digits
*77 — activates Anonymous Call Rejection Service
*82 and 1182 — releases Caller ID block on a call-by-call basis
*87 — deactivates Anonymous Call Rejection Service
The four-digit numbers are not implemented in some areas. The star codes (*) are for use on Touch-Tone telephones, whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are used on rotary dial telephones which cannot dial the * symbol.
Not all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the emergency telephone number is not always 911: Trinidad and Tobago and Dominica use 999, as in the United Kingdom. The country of Barbados uses 211 for police force, 311 for fire, and 511 for ambulance, while Jamaica uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for police force, and 110 for fire and ambulance services.
Despite its early importance as a share of the worldwide telephone system, few of the NANP's codes, such as 911, have been adopted outside the system. Determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on rotary dial telephones, the European Union has adopted its own standardized number of 112, while countries in Asia and the rest of the world use a variety of other two- or three-digit emergency telephone number combinations. The 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the European GSM standard. The European Union and many other countries have chosen the International Telecommunication Union's 00 as their international access number instead of 011. However, the toll-free prefix 800 has been adopted widely elsewhere, including as the international toll-free country code. It is often preceded by a 0 rather than a 1 in many countries where 0 is the trunk prefix.

International dialing[edit]
While direct dialing of international calls was available in some locations in the United States by the late 1950s, a continental system was introduced as
International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD) for the territories of the North American Numbering Plan in March 1970.[49]
IDDD was implemented through extensive modifications in the switching systems to accommodate the international open numbering plan with seven to twelve digits in the national telephone numbers.[50] Access to the international network is facilitated by the dialing prefix 011, after which the country code and the national telephone number are dialed.

Number portability[edit]
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. § 251 (b)(2)) authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require all local exchange carriers (LECs) to offer local number portability.[51] The FCC regulations were enacted on June 27, 1996, with changes to take effect in the one hundred largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by October 1, 1997, and elsewhere by December 31, 1998.[52]
The FCC directed the North American Numbering Council (NANC) to select one or more private-sector candidates for the local number portability administrator (LNPA) function,[53] in a manner akin to the selection of the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA).[54]
The toll-free telephone numbers in NPA 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844, and 833 have been portable through the RespOrg system since 1993.[55]

Toll charges[edit]
Telephone calls between countries and territories of the NANP are not typically charged at domestic rates. For example, most long-distance plans may charge a California subscriber a higher rate for a call to British Columbia than for a call to New York, even though both destinations are within the NANP. Similarly, calls from Bermuda to U.S. destinations incur international rates. Even toll-free numbers may incur charges to callers. This is because many of the island nations implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local telephone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international long-distance services.[citation needed]
Because of these higher fees, scams had taken advantage of customers' unfamiliarity with pricing to call the legacy regional area code 809. Some scams lured customers from the United States and Canada into placing expensive calls to the Caribbean, by representing area code 809 as a regular domestic, low-cost, or toll-free call. The split of 809 (which formerly served all of the Caribbean NANP points) into multiple new area codes created many new, unfamiliar prefixes which could be mistaken for U.S. or Canada domestic area codes but carried high tariffs. In various island nations, premium exchanges such as +1-876-HOT-, +1-876-WET- or +1-876-SEX- (where 876 is Jamaica) became a means to circumvent consumer-protection laws governing area code 900 or similar U.S.-domestic premium numbers.
The occurrence of these scams has been decreasing, with many of the Cable and Wireless service monopolies being opened to competition, hence decreasing rates. Additionally, many Caribbean territories have implemented local government agencies to regulate telecommunications rates of providers.[56][57]

Countries and territories[edit]
Of all states or territories, the U.S. state of California has the largest number of area codes assigned, followed by Texas, Florida and New York, while most countries of the Caribbean use only one.[58] Many Caribbean codes were assigned based on alphabetic abbreviations of the territory name, as indicated in the third column of the following table (Letter code). This follows the traditional letter assignments on telephone dials. For some Pacific islands, the NANPA area code is the same as the country code that was discontinued upon membership in the NANP.

Membership in the NANP brings significant advantages for countries in the vicinity of the United States and Canada, which usually are already the main dialing destinations. Both countries also originate most of the tourism business for the Caribbean. This is enhanced by the integration from sharing the same dialing procedures, without international access codes, and the toll-free number system of the NANP, as businesses in all member countries are eligible to participate.

Despite the abandonment of telephone exchange names in telephone numbering plans, many telephone dials and keypads maintain a tradition of alphabetic dialing. Pushbuttons from digit 2 to 9 also displays letters, which is standardized in ISO 9995-8 and, in Europe, E.161. The alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as shown in the table.
The Glenn Miller tune PEnnsylvania 6-5000 refers to telephone number PE6-5000, a number in service at the Hotel Pennsylvania (212 736-5000) in New York City until the hotel's closing in 2020. Similarly, the movie BUtterfield 8 is set in the East Side of Manhattan between roughly 64th and 86th Streets, where the telephone prefixes include 288.
The letter system was phased out, beginning before 1965, although it persisted ten years later in some places. It was included in Bell of Pennsylvania directories until 1983. Some businesses still display a 2L-5N number in advertisements, e.g., the Belvedere Construction Company in Detroit, Michigan not only still uses the 2L-5N format for its number (TYler 8-7100), it uses the format for the toll-free number (1-800-TY8-7100).
Despite the phasing out of the letter system, alphabetic phonewords remain as a commercial mnemonic gimmick, particularly for toll-free numbers. For example, one can dial 1-800-FLOWERS to order flowers, or 1-800-DENTIST to find a local dentist.
In addition to uses in advertising, alphabetic dialing has occasionally influenced the selection of area codes. For example, when area code 423 (East Tennessee) was split in 1999, the region surrounding Knoxville was assigned area code 865, chosen to represent VOL, for The Volunteer State, the nickname of Tennessee, as well as athletic teams at the University of Tennessee.[60][61] Similarly, several Caribbean area codes were chosen as an alphabetic abbreviation of the name of the country or its capital.

Fictional telephone numbers[edit]
American television programs and movies often use the central office code 555, or KLamath 5 and KLondike 5 in older movies and shows, for fictitious telephone numbers, to prevent disturbing actual telephone subscribers if anyone is tempted to dial a telephone number seen or referred to on screen. Not all numbers beginning with 555 are fictional. For example, 555-1212 is the standard number for directory assistance. Only 555-0100 through 555-0199 are reserved for fictional use. Where used, these are often routed to information services; Canadian telephone companies briefly promoted 555-1313 as a pay-per-use "name that number" reverse lookup during the mid-1990s.[62]
Occasionally, valid telephone numbers are used as song titles. The 1962 Motown hit "Beechwood 4-5789" was written by Marvin Gaye for The Marvelettes, while Stax/Volt Records' Wilson Pickett scored a soul music success during the 1960s with the similarly named "634-5789". A more recent example is the 1981 song "867-5309/Jenny" by Tommy Tutone, which was the cause of a large number of prank calls.[63]

Telephone numbers in AlbaniaLocation of Albania (dark green)LocationCountryAlbaniaContinentEuropeRegulatorAKEPTypeOpenFormat0XX XXX XXXAccess codesCountry code+355International access00Long-distance0
For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialled before the user number of another administrative unit. The prefix for international calls from Albania is 00 (e.g., for a United States number 00 1 ... should be dialled). Below is an explanation when dialling a number within the Tirana administrative unit:

     0 4 xxx xxxx    (from within the Tirana administrative unit)
     0 4 xxx xxxx    (from within Albania, but outside Tirana)
  +355 4 xxx xxxx    (from outside Albania)


History[edit]
Albania has the lowest rate of telephone use per capita in Europe with roughly 10 lines per 100 people as of 2008 ITU statistics. As a result, cellular phone use is very common throughout the country. The numbering plan has constantly evolved during the last 30 years. Tirana has passed to a seven digit plan as of 2008 from a four digit plan in the communist period by gradually adding one digit.

New Numbering Plan and Addition of Digit "2"[edit]
As of March 2008, a new numbering plan was introduced in an effort to improve the quality of the service and increase fixed phone use in Albania. The old plan stayed in effect in parallel to the new until 15 September 2008.
The new numbering plan introduces a new digit, represented by the number 2 that is put in front of local telephone numbers country-wide.
For example, to dial a Tirana number with the old plan, it would have looked like XXX XXX. With the new plan, the digit 2 is added to form 2XXX XXX. The old plan is defunct and not longer in operation.
In total, there are 8 digits for every phone number in the country.
Additionally, changes include the replacement of the Municipality of Laç's calling code with the new 53 code.

Numbering plan by Municipality (effective 15 September 2008)[edit]
This is a list of prior area codes within Albania, incorporated into the user number as of 1 January 2014. To call from one administrative unit to another one, the digit "0" still has to be dialled first, but there is no change when calling from outside Albania.

Telephone numbers in AndorraLocation of AndorraLocationCountryAndorraContinentEuropeNSN  length6Access codesCountry code+376International access00Long-distancenone
Telephone numbers in Andorra are six digits, with fixed line numbers beginning with the digits 8 and 7 and mobile telephone numbers with the digits 3 and 6. Toll-free numbers are eight digits, beginning with 1800 (if they are accessible only within Andorra) or 1802 (if they also can be reached internationally). Three-digit numbers starting with 1 are reserved and six-digit numbers starting with 9 are reserved for special services, and nine-digit number starting with 690 are assigned to special mobile services such as machine to machine communications.[1]
Until 1994, Andorra formed part of the French numbering plan, with the prefix 628 being used for calls from France[2] (or 16 628 from Paris)[3] while +33 628 was used from the rest of the world.[4] Access was also possible via the Spanish numbering plan using the area code 9738, or the international prefix +34 738.[3] On 17 December of that year, Andorra adopted its own country code, +376.[5] This meant that all international calls to the Principality, including those from France and Spain, required the use of the +376 country code.[6]

Type of telephone numbers in Argentina
Telephone numbers in ArgentinaLocationCountryArgentinaContinentSouth AmericaRegulatorENACOMTypeOpenAccess codesCountry code+54International access00Long-distance0
In Argentina, area codes are two, three, or four digits long (after the initial zero). Local customer numbers are six to eight digits long. The total number of digits is ten, for example, phone number (11) 1234-5678 for Buenos Aires is made up of a 2-digit area code number and an 8-digit subscriber's number, while (383) 123-4567 would be an example of a Catamarca number.


Local dialing[edit]
Local landline phone numbers in Argentina can have 6, 7 or 8 digits, depending on where they are located:

Most of Greater Buenos Aires uses 8 digits.
Second-tier cities use 7 digits.
Remaining towns and cities use 6 digits.
Local numbers usually begin with a 4, although in recent times numbers having 2, 3, 5, 6, or even 7 and 8 as the first digit are not uncommon.
Thus, for example to call a local number within Buenos Aires, one should dial 1234–5678; within Mar del Plata, 123-4567 and within Villa Carlos Paz, 12–3456. For mobile phone dialing, see the corresponding section below.

Recent changes[edit]
In March 2011, the National Communications Commission announced changes to be carried out in 21 local areas throughout the country. The reason being the soaring demand in mobile lines causing lines to be nearly depleted in many areas. The changes will take place in three stages, starting in November 2011 with the final cities having their numbering plan changed in April 2012. Users in these areas will have an extra 4 added in front of their subscriber's numbers as well as having the area code shortened. Thus, they will go from a (xxxx) xx-xxxx format to a more resourceful (xxx) xxx-xxxx. On 1 April, seven cities had their numbering changed as described above, thus completing the update process.[1][2][3][4]

Long-distance dialing[edit]
To dial a long-distance number in Argentina (whether landline or mobile), the area code must be dialed before the subscriber's number.
As explained before, area codes can have 2, 3 or 4 digits and must be dialed before the local subscriber's phone number.
In addition, to place a domestic long-distance call, trunk code 0 must be dialed as well.
Thus, for example, in order to call a landline phone in Ushuaia from Salta, one should dial: 0 + 2901 + xx-xxxx, where 0 is the trunk code, 2901 is the Ushuaia area code, and xx-xxxx is the local phone number.
The same rule applies to mobile phone numbers, with the addition of the mobile prefix 15 right in front of the local subscriber's number. Using the same example above, to reach a Ushuaia mobile from Córdoba, one should dial: 0 + 2901 + 15 + xx-xxxx
Although trunk code 0 is not part of the long-distance area code, it is normally represented as if it were part of the long-distance prefix. Thus, when given a long-distance number already including a 0 in front of it, no additional 0 is to be added in order to call domestically.

Mobile phone numbers[edit]
Mobile phone numbers in Argentina are assigned the same geographic area codes as fixed lines, according to the subscriber's choice or residence, and can be 6, 7 or 8 digits long, just as landline numbers are. The difference with mobile numbers is that a prefix 15, never used for landlines, must be dialed.
Calling a mobile phone locally requires dialing 15, followed by the subscriber's number. For example, to call a Villa Carlos Paz mobile number from Villa Carlos Paz, 15 xx-xxxx must be dialled. To call a mobile phone in a different area code, the area code must be dialed, followed by the mobile prefix 15 and the number. For example, to call a Mar del Plata mobile from Buenos Aires, the dialing pattern is 0 223 15 xxx-xxxx, where 0 is the trunk code, 223 is the Mar del Plata area code, 15 is the mobile prefix, followed by the seven-digit subscriber number.
Here are some examples of mobile phone numbers in Argentina:

(11) 15 1234-5678 Buenos Aires.
(380) 15 123-4567 La Rioja.
(2966) 15 12-3456 Río Gallegos.
The prefix 15 is not part of the number, although users sometimes give out their numbers with the prefix included. This is not a problem when making calls within Argentina, but can cause confusion when the mobile prefix must be omitted, as on IVR menus or when calling from abroad.
Mobile prefix 15 and trunk code 0 can be omitted when calling a mobile from another mobile within Argentina.
Different prefixes are required when calling mobile numbers from outside Argentina.

Number portability[edit]
In 2000 President Fernando De La Rúa signed a decree[5] deregulating the telephone service in Argentina, thus allowing number portability to be implemented. In December 2011, Argentine authorities postponed number portability once again—allegedly due to lobbying from operators—until March 2012.[6]
The intention is that users of landline and mobile telephones in Argentina will be able to switch providers while keeping their phone number, so long as they remain in the same subscriber local area."International Union of Local Authorities". Retrieved 10 April 2014.
Number portability is expected to bring lower rates and better service quality, since operators will have to carry out additional efforts, both to keep their existing customers from leaving and to attract other operators' users to their networks.

International calls[edit]
Inbound[edit]
Inbound international calls to landline numbers follow the same rules as calls within the country. International access code +54  must be used in order to call Argentina, followed by the area code and then the local phone number. The "+" sign must be replaced by an international call prefix specific to the country originating the call, e.g. 00 from the UK, 011 from the US, etc.
For example, to call the number (351) 123–4567 in the city of Córdoba from Mexico, the dialing sequence is 00 54 351 123–4567.
Mobile phone numbers follow a different pattern. The prefix 9 must be added before the area code, leaving out the 15 after the area code, which is only used when calling domestically. The inbound dialing pattern for mobiles is then: +54, 9, area code, mobile subscriber's number (notice how the 15 domestic prefix is omitted). For example, to call mobile number (223) 15 123-4567 (in Mar del Plata) from outside Argentina, the dialling sequence is: +54 9 223 123–4567.
Non-geographic numbers such as 0800 or 0810 cannot be called from outside Argentina. Some companies do not publish their geographic number, and can only be called internationally by obtaining it some other way.

Inbound SMS[edit]
To send an SMS text message to an Argentine cell phone from another country, the 9 used internationally when dialing the number for a voice call (and the 15 used for calls within Argentina) is omitted. For example, if the mobile number in Argentina is (11) 15 1234–5678, a voice call from abroad would be dialled as +54 9 11 1234 5678, but a text message would require +54 11 1234 5678, with +54 9 11 1234 5678 usually being invalid. If a text message is received from Argentina, the reply can be sent to the number displayed as the sender. Not all mobile providers in Argentina have SMS agreements with every carrier in the world,[7] so it may not be possible to send an international SMS.

Outbound[edit]
Outbound international calls use a trunk prefix 00 followed by the international code for the country being called, and then the area code (if any) and local phone number.
For example, to call the number (9) 123–4567 in Auckland, New Zealand, the dialing sequence will be: 00 64 9 123–4567; where 00 is the international trunk code, 64 is the country code for New Zealand, 9 is the Auckland area code, and 123-4567 is the local number.
Although Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, international dialling using the 00 prefix and the country code 500 is required.[8] However, following a court ruling in 2017, calls to the Islands have been charged at domestic rates.[9]

Collect calls[edit]
Domestic collect calls are placed by dialing 19 from any landline or payphone; the caller then states their name, which is announced with a message stating that a collect call has been requested when the call is answered. If the called party accepts the reverse charges, the call is connected.
International collect calls are placed by dialling 000 for the international operator; this number also provides international assistance, such as country and area codes, rates, etc.

Non-geographic numbers[edit]
Non-geographic numbers have a three-digit prefix followed by a seven-digit number. They are usually represented in the format 0ppp-nnn-nnnn.
Prefixes allocated as of 2013[update] include:

0800: toll-free telephone numbers
0810: calls from any area chargeable at local rate
0822: toll-free numbers used for calling card access
0600: premium-rate telephone numbers
0609: premium, fixed-rate gaming numbers
0610: dial-up Internet access numbers, usually cheaper than a local call, less frequently used as dial-up Internet access decreased
0605: premium-rate telephone numbers for charity donations
Public utility numbers[edit]
The format for public utility service phone numbers is mostly 1xx. They can be accessed from any landline, mobile or pay phone within the country.
The most common public utility service numbers are:[10][11]

100: Firefighters
101: Police
102: Child services
103: Civil defense
106: Naval Prefecture
107: Ambulance
110: Phone directory
112: Customer service
113: Official time[12]
114: Phone repair service [13]
115: Ring test
121: Phone usage info (subject to availability)
125: Assistance service for the hearing-impaired
911: Emergency (only in cities where 100, 101 and 107 have been merged into one emergency number, such as the Buenos Aires Metro Area and Buenos Aires Province[14])

This article needs to be updated. The reason given is: Information regarding Artsakh has to be rewritten or removed (to distinguish it from the active/existent telephone numbers of Armenia). Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2023)

The following telephone numbers in Armenia are destination codes for international calls terminating in Armenia as well as the procedures for dialing internationally from within Armenia.


Dialling plan[edit]
The dialling plan is as below:

Calling Armenia from abroad[edit]
From abroad to Yerevan, regions, mobile network, Artsakh fixed telephone network and Artsakh mobile network:

  + 374 + Destination Code + Subscriber Number           (to Yerevan, regions)
  + 374 + Mobile Network Code + Mobile Subscriber Number (to mobile network)
  + 374 + 47 + Subscriber Number                         (to Artsakh fixed telephone network)
  + 374 + 97 + Subscriber Number                         (to Artsakh mobile network)

Calling from Armenia[edit]
From Yerevan, regions, mobile network and Artsakh to abroad:

  00 + Country Code + Destination Code + Subscriber Number

Calls to North America from anywhere in Armenia receive a substantial discount if preceded by a special code specific to each Armenian phone company.
For example, if one makes a call from a Vivacell-MTS phone to North America and dials 77 first, one is charged 14 AMD per minute. It is the same deal for callers from a Beeline (whether a mobile or landline) if a call is preceded by *88*.
Thus, from a Vivacell phone one must dial; 77 + 00 + Country Code (1 for North America) + Destination Code + Subscriber Number
And from a beeline phone (landline or cell) one must dial: *88* + 00 + Country Code (1 for North America) [1]+ Destination Code + Subscriber Number

Calling within Armenia and Artsakh[edit]
  0 + Destination Code + Subscriber Number

Calling Artsakh from Armenia[edit]
From Yerevan, regions and mobile network to Artsakh fixed telephone network and Artsakh mobile network:

  0 + 47 + Subscriber Number                      (to Artsakh fixed telephone network)
  0 + 97 + Subscriber Number                      (to Artsakh mobile network)

Example[edit]
An example for calling telephones in Yerevan, Armenia is as follows:

               Subscriber Number  (within Yerevan)
      0 + 10 + Subscriber Number  (within Armenia and Artsakh)
  + 374 + 10 + Subscriber Number  (outside Armenia and Artsakh)

Telephone numbers in ArubaLocationCountryArubaContinentSouth AmericaFormat+297 NNX XXXXAccess codesCountry code+297International access00
Telephone numbers in Aruba have country code 297. It is one of the few countries outside Africa to have a country code starting with 2. Before Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986, it was part of the Netherlands Antilles numbering plan (+599)[1] with phone numbers starting with +599 8. Landline numbers begin with 28, 52 or 58.[2] Mobile numbers begin with a 56, 59, 64, 73, 74 or 99.  Numbers are seven digits long, otherwise in line with the North American Numbering Plan, despite not being part of it.

Telephone numbers in AustraliaLocation of Australia (dark green)LocationCountryAustraliaContinentOceaniaRegulatorAustralian Communications and Media AuthorityTypeOpenAccess codesCountry code61International access0011Long-distance0
The Australian telephone numbering plan governs the allocation of telephone numbers in Australia. It has changed many times, the most recent major reorganisation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority taking place between 1994 and 1998.[1]


Overview[edit]
For landline telephony, Australia is geographically divided into four areas, three of which cover more than one state or territory. All local telephone numbers within the four areas have eight digits, consisting (mainly) of a four-digit exchange code and a four-digit local line number. The national significant number consists of a single-digit area code followed by the local eight-digit number, a total of nine digits. Calling within Australia a landline telephone in an area other than that of the caller, the telephone number is preceded by the Australian trunk prefix 0 and the area code: 0x xxxx xxxx.

00 International and Emergency access (see below for details)
01 Alternative phone services
014 Satellite phones
0163 Pager numbers
0198 Data numbers (e.g. 0198 308 888 is the dial-up PoP number for Telstra)
02 Geographic: Central East region (NSW, ACT, small parts of Victoria)
03 Geographic: South-east region (VIC, TAS)
04 Digital Mobile services (3G, 4G, 5G and GSM)
0550 Location Independent Communication Services
07 Geographic: North-east region (QLD)
08 Geographic: Central and West region (SA, NT, WA, small part of NSW)
1 Non-geographic numbers (mostly for domestic use only; see below for details)
The current numbering plan would appear to be sufficient to cope with potential increase in demand for services for quite some time to come.[citation needed] The 06 and 09 area codes are unused.  In addition, each other area code has large number ranges unallocated.[citation needed]
When dialling from outside Australia, after dialling the appropriate international access code, it is necessary to dial the country code for Australia (61) followed by the nine digit national significant number. (The + symbol is used to represent the International Access Code, e.g. +61 3 xxxx xxxx for a number in Victoria/Tasmania or +61 4xx xxx xxx for a mobile number). Some numbers beginning with a 1 may be dialled without any replacement, after dialling the required international access code and the country code.
Australian local numbers have eight digits, conventionally written in the form xxxx xxxx. Mobile numbers are written in the form of ten digits, when dialed within Australia, the 0 must be included, and 4, which indicates the service required is a mobile number. Mobile numbers are conventionally written 04xx xxx xxx. If a landline or mobile number is written where it may be viewed by an international audience (e.g. in an email signature or on a website) then the number is often written as +61 x xxxx xxxx or +61 4xx xxx xxx respectively.
The Australian national trunk access code, 0, is not used for calls originated from locations outside Australia.

Geographic numbers[edit]
Fixed-line telephone numbers[edit]
Within Australia, dialing a number in another area requires dialing the trunk code 0, followed by the area code, and then the local number.
In major centres, the first four digits specify the CCA (Call Collection Area, also known as an exchange), and the remaining digits specify a number at that exchange, up to 10,000 of which may be connected. Smaller exchanges in more remote areas may mean that no more than 100 numbers could be connected to such exchanges.
To access numbers in the same area, it is necessary only to dial the eight digits concerned.  To access a number in another area it is first necessary to dial the trunk code of 0, followed by the area code (2, 3, 7 or 8) and then the specific local number.
The area codes do not exactly match state/territory boundaries. Notable are the part of New South Wales around Broken Hill (a large part of the state's area but less than 1% of its population), which uses (08) 80xx numbers,[2] and Wodonga, which is in Victoria but is within the New South Wales (02) area code. Similarly New South Wales border towns including Deniliquin and Buronga are within the South East (Victorian) (03) area code, and Tweed Heads within the North East (Queensland) (07) area code. Physical exchanges can be allocated one or more prefixes and modern technology allows sub-sets of these number ranges to be allocated to switching entities physically located at a distance from the exchange in which their controlling terminal is located. (Thus, the concept of what a "telephone exchange" is can become somewhat blurred.)
Landlines use an open dialling plan: if the caller's phone shares the same area code as the called phone, the area code may be omitted. For example, a call from the number (02) 5551 5678, to the number (02) 7010 1111, will be connected if the caller dials only 7010 1111. Similarly, a person who dials 7010 5678 on a land-line or mobile phone in Melbourne (i.e., within the 03 area) will be connected to 03 7010 5678. For this reason, landline numbers are often specified without the area code. If a person's number and the destination number share the same area code, then the area code is not required, even if it is not a local (untimed) call.
However, the full international number must always be dialled, since the Australian telephone network has the capability to recognise when the destination required is either international, in a different national area or within the local area and to switch and charge the call accordingly.  Thus, it is strongly recommended that telephone numbers should be stored in mobile phones in the form of the full international number, should the owner of the phone be likely to use the phone concerned in an area away from home, either within Australia or internationally.

Mobile phones[edit]
Within Australia, mobile phone numbers begin with 04 or 05 – the Australian national trunk code 0, plus the mobile indicator 4 or 5 – followed by eight digits. This is generally written as 04XX XXX XXX within Australia, or as +61 4XX XXX XXX for an international audience.  This format is the result of mobile carriers advertising numbers in such a way so as to clearly identify the owning telco prior to mobile number portability, introduced on 25 September 2001.  Prior to MNP, mobile operators generally reserved number ranges in blocks of 04 xy z.
The xy-digit codes (sometimes xy z) are allocated per network. Since the introduction of number portability, there is no longer a fixed relationship between the mobile phone number and the network it uses.
In 2015 the 05 prefix (other than 0550) was also reserved for digital mobile phones as a part of the Telecommunications Numbering Plan 2015. However, as of 2019 no numbers have been allocated with this prefix.
Within Australia, mobile numbers must always be dialed with all 10 digits, regardless of the caller's location.

Mobile phone numbers (04, 05)[edit]
Each mobile phone company is allocated numbers in blocks, which are listed below. However mobile number portability means an individual number might have been "ported". There are also many MVNOs which use numbers from their wholesaler or might have their own ranges.
ACMA planned to introduce the "05" range for mobile numbers in 2017, when the "04" range was expected to be exhausted.[5] So far, no such numbers have been introduced.

Satellite phone numbers (014)[edit]
Numbers beginning with 014 are predominantly used for satellite services. Parts of the 014 prefix had previously been used as a 9 digit, AMPS mobile phone access code.
The 01471 prefix is the ten-digit replacement for the previous, nine-digit ITERRA satellite phone code 0071 xxxxx. Prior to its use for ITERRA (and other satellite services). These numbers were allocated in March 1999.
0145xxxxxx numbers are used for services utilised on the Optus network in Australia. This is predominantly used for MobileSat and Thuraya mobile satellite services. These numbers were allocated in December 1992: 222,000 with the rest "spare".
The prefixes 0141, 0142, 0143, 0145 and 0147 are set aside for satellite systems; the rest of the 014 prefix range is currently not allocated to any other service type. There is not a lot of demand for these services, and many satellite phones now have normal mobile phone numbers (prefix 04), so it is not likely for the entire 014 range to be allocated to satellite services.

Location independent communications service (0550)[edit]
These numbers are designed for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) systems, where they work like a fixed number but not allocated on a geographical level. It is possible that LICS numbers will be absorbed into mobile numbers in the future, as they provide similar features. Indeed, the July 2012 variation of the numbering plan allocated the rest of the 05 range to digital mobile numbering.[7]

Data numbers (0198)[edit]
All calls to 0198 numbers are a "local call" cost like 13 and 1300 numbers but are used for Internet service provider access numbers. They are used both with dial-up modems and ISDN.

Obsolete numbers[edit]
Most numbers that are no longer used have been removed from the Telecommunications Numbering Plan 2015, whether in previous variations or in this complete replacement. (See below)
However, the 0163 prefix is still allocated for use with pagers. This was reduced from 016 in a variation to the previous numbering plan. As of March 2011 only 1000 numbers were allocated, and by the end of 2012 there were none allocated.

List of non-geographic numbers (domestic use)[edit]
The following codes are not generally dialable from international points, but used in domestic dialling:

000 – Emergency (Police, Fire, Ambulance)
106 – TTY emergency (for the hearing-impaired)
11 – Community services
1100 – Before You Dig Australia (to prevent inadvertent damage to underground cables or infrastructure)
112 – Alternative access to Emergency Services (Police, Fire, Ambulance; diallable from GSM mobile phones only)
119x – Information services (e.g. 1194 was time and 1196 was weather (both disabled from 1 October 2019))
12 – Network services
1221 – International faults reporting service
1222 – Call costs and enquiries service
1223 – Directory assistance
1225 – International directory assistance
123x – Premium operator services (e.g. 1234 is Sensis personal assistance)
124xx – Other operator services (e.g. 12456 is Sensis Call Connect)
125xxx – Telstra mobile services (e.g. 125111 is Telstra mobile customer service)

Some notes:

These numbers do not have a Trunk Access Code prefix (0).
The 106 number is believed to be the first nationwide TTY emergency service in the world.
13 xx xx, 1300 xxx xxx and 1800 xxx xxx numbers can provide source-based routing, used by organisations such as pizza chains that advertise one number nationwide that connects customers to their nearest store.
Virtually all FreeCall numbers in use are 1800 xxx xxx, though some organisations do use the shorter 7-digit version.[8]
Some of these numbers are dialable from locations outside Australia. It is up to the individual owner to set this up correctly (for 13 and 18 numbers at least) (e.g. +61 13x xxx)
911 will not re-route to triple zero as the prefix 911x has been allocated to landlines under the current numbering plan.[9] 911 may redirect to 000 when using a mobile phone, like 112, but it is not encouraged as knowledge of these numbers causes confusion
Emergency services numbers (000, 106, 112)[edit]
000 is the primary emergency telephone number in Australia.[10] Secondary emergency numbers are 106 (for use by the hearing impaired with a TTY terminal) and the international GSM mobile emergency telephone number 112.
Increased awareness of the 112 emergency number[10] in Australia has led to the potential for confusion over which number to call in an emergency. As a secondary emergency number, 112 is not guaranteed to work from all technologies; most notably, it does not work from landlines.[11] In order to encourage use of 000, mobile telephones imported commercially into Australia are required to be programmed to treat 000 in the same fashion as 112 (i.e. dialling with key lock enabled, use of any carrier, preferential routing, etc.).[12] On older or privately imported (e.g. roaming from another country) telephones, 000 may not receive such preferential treatment.

Local Rate and FreeCall numbers (13, 180)[edit]
Australia uses the free call prefix 1800 for 10 digit freecall numbers. This is similar to the North American or NANPA prefix 1–800, but while in North America, the 1 is the long-distance or toll prefix and 800 is the area code; 1800 in Australia is itself a "virtual area code" (prior to the introduction of 8-digit numbers, the free call code was 008). There are also seven digit freecall numbers beginning with 180 – the only numbers currently allocated begin with 1802.
The 13 and 1300 numbers are known as Local Rate Numbers or SmartNumbers.[13]  They are also known as priority 13, and priority 1300 numbers.  These work across large areas (potentially the whole of Australia) and charge the caller only a low cost, routing the call to the appropriate place in a given area. For example, a company could have the number 139999 and have the telephone company set it up so that calls made in Melbourne would route to their Melbourne number, calls made in Brisbane to their Brisbane number, and calls made anywhere else in Australia route to their Sydney number, all at a local charge cost to the caller. 13 numbers were not available before the introduction of the current 8-digit local numbering plan. Businesses looking for local callers tend to connect to a "1300" number. Note that these numbers are called "Local Rate" and not "Local" numbers, so do not necessarily cost the same as a local call: Indeed, many (landline and mobile) phone plans do not even include them in the "included" credit and/or charge them at a higher rate than "normal" numbers.
Though promoted as "local call rate" calls, calls to 13 and 1300 numbers cost more than a local call fee for those people using VoIP and having all local and national calls free.[citation needed]
1800, 1300 and 13 numbers are reverse charge networks. Other than the length of the number, the differences between a 13 number and a 1300 number is that the shorter number has a higher fee for the owner of the number: there should be no difference in cost to the caller. A call to an 1800 is free when dialled from a landline, and mobile phones since 2014.[14] It depends on the individual mobile plan as how 13 and 1300 numbers are charged: all plans no longer charge for 1800 but 13 and 1300 may still be charged at a high rate, or outside included calls.
These numbers "forward" to a geographic or mobile number. The recipient is usually charged at a set rate per second for each call, depending on plan and destination.

Premium numbers (19)[edit]
190x (not to be confused with 0198) is the prefix for premium rate services (e.g. recorded information, competition lines, psychics, phone sex, etc.). (Prior to the introduction of 8-digit local numbers, the prefix was 0055.) 190 numbers incur a rate as charged by the provider – either at a per-minute rate (limited at $5.50 per minute) or a fixed rate (up to $38.50 per call). The latter method is most often used for fax-back services, where a timed charge is not appropriate. Costs of 190 calls for competitions involving chance are also often limited by state legislation to $0.55 per call. (In the previous numbering plan, 0055 numbers were limited to three bands: Premium Rate, Value Rate and Budget Rate, with per minute rates of $0.75, $0.60 and $0.40 respectively.)
Other numbers beginning with 19 are used for premium-rate SMS services. These were originally trialled using the 188 prefix. These can range from a standard SMS cost (usually 25c), up to 55c for competition use, to several dollars for other uses, such as unique bid auctions.

International access[edit]
The main international prefix is 0011. (E.164 international format is supported from phones with the ability to dial the '+' symbol.[15])
There are other codes for using a non-default carrier or a special plan:

0014 will route through the Primus network
0018 will route through the Telstra network
0019 will route through the Optus network
Formerly, 0015 would route through Telstra on a special mode for international faxing. Telstra has retired this code.
Carrier selection codes (14xx) are now also used, and carrier pre-selection is widely used.

Carrier selection codes[edit]
These four-digit numbers are dialled before the destination number to complete and bill a call by a carrier other than the subscriber's service provider. For example, to use AAPT to call a number in Tokyo, Japan, subscribers would dial 1414 0011 81 3 xxxx xxxx, or to use Optus to call a number in Perth they would dial 1456 08 xxxx xxxx. It is not clear if all these prefixes will actually work. Not all carriers have interconnect agreements with each other

Historical numbering plans[edit]
Main article: Former Australian dialling codes
2010s[edit]
Many old numbers were officially removed from the Telecommunications Numbering Plan in the 2015 version, whether in the replacement version or a previous variation.

018 AMPS phone numbers are completely removed.
0500 Personal Numbers are removed.
Unused prefixes such as 114 mass calling service are removed.
1990s[edit]
0055 numbers were previously premium-rate numbers, but have been moved into 190 numbers before 1999.
The original toll-free area code was 008, but the format was changed to 1800.
Directory assistance used various numbers: 013 for local calls, 0175 for other national calls, and 0103 for international. The two domestic numbers have been replaced with 1223, while 0103 was replaced with 1225. Other numbers for directory assistance, often with a call connection option, exist depending on the carrier.
011 was initially the code for the operator, 0011 later became the international exit code.
014 was originally the number for the time, (later 1104), which was changed to 1194 in 1976.
0176 was originally the code for the operator when calling from a Public Telephone. It became the code for the reverse-charge call operator, which was moved to 12550. Alternatively 3rd-party companies exist. See Collect call#Australia

1960s[edit]
Up to this time, the maximum size of an Australian telephone number was six digits.
Until the early 1960s, the first one or two digits of telephone numbers in metropolitan areas were alphabetic, with each letter representing a distinct number on the telephone dial. Each one-letter or two-letter code signified an exchange within an urban area. Rural and regional areas typically relied on manual exchanges, or only one automatic exchange for the whole town, so rural and regional numbers did not feature these letter prefixes. The use of a letter-number combination also served as a memory aid as it was easier to remember than a string of digits in the days when such things were not as common.
Unlike the three (or fewer) letters associated with each of the numbers on the dials of telephones of the UK Director telephone system, which was used in London and other large British cities, Australia used a system of letters associated with the ten digits available on a telephone dial, where each of these letters were chosen because their "name" (when pronounced, in English) could not be confused with any of the other nine letters of the English/Latin alphabet which were also used.
Since the initial digits of 1 and 0 (ten) were not used, this gave the telephone company concerned up to 8 regions with main exchanges and up to ten sub-exchanges in each metropolitan area – a total of up to 80 individual exchanges of 10,000 numbers in each with up to only 800,000 individual "numbers" in any metropolitan area concerned. This limited capacity led to the need for a seven- or eight-digit numbering system, to allow for more "numbers" within a given area.
Because of the growth of the telephone network, Australia now has eight-digit telephone numbers within four areas.
This former alphanumeric scheme was significantly different from the current system used for SMS messages.
The former alphanumeric scheme was:

A = 1;
B = 2;
F = 3;
J = 4;
L = 5;
M = 6;
U = 7;
W = 8;
X = 9;
Y = 0
The letters did not relate to any exchange name. For example, the exchange prefix for Essendon was FU (which translated to 37 and later became the 37x [then 937x] exchange used by the whole City of Essendon [which became the City of Moonee Valley in late 1994]). Although Melbourne city numbers began with 6, it was only rarely, and probably by accident, that any other exchanges had matching letters. Numbers using the old alphanumeric scheme were written as ab.xxxx, for example FU 1234 (the actual train of digits sent to the phone was "371234") or MW 5550 (685550). Seven-digit numbers started appearing as early as 1960, and were all numerical from the start. There were still some six-digit numbers and at least one five-digit number in Melbourne as late as 1989, but by the 1990s, they all had been converted to seven-digit numbers. Footscray used six-digit numbers in exchange code 68 until 1987, when they were changed to 687 or 689.
The old call back number was 199, and could be used on public payphones, and private numbers too. This was moved to a new number 12722199.

Telephone numbers in Austria have no standard lengths for either area codes or subscriber numbers, meaning that some subscriber numbers may be as short as three digits. Larger towns have shorter area codes permitting longer subscriber numbers in that area.

1 Telering was bought by T-Mobile in 2005. As of 2006, Telering uses the network-infrastructure of T-Mobile. As a special requirement of the European commission, many of the former transmitters and frequencies previously operated by Telering were given to Orange and Drei.
2 BoB is a discount service of A1. yesss! was a discount service of Orange, now sold to A1. Eety is a discount service of Orange (now 3).
Due to Mobile number portability, the code is not an accurate way to determine the provider of a mobile phone number. The providers assign only in exceptional cases (special sort of custom numbers, more expensive) non-existing numbers with a different prefix, and this is handled similarly to porting an existing number from the desired network. However, the providers still have administrative sovereignty over their own prefixes.

Telephone numbers in AzerbaijanLocation of Azerbaijan (green)LocationCountryAzerbaijanContinentAsiaTypeclosedAccess codesCountry code+994International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Azerbaijan follow the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector E.164 recommended format its telephone numbering plan.
A caller from outside Azerbaijan would dial the international access number (international call prefix) of the originating country (00 for many countries, 011 from NANP areas), then dial the country code (in this case 994), omit the trunk prefix, then dial the two-digit area code, and then the seven-digit local number.
For example, to reach the US embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, a caller in the United States would dial 011-994-12-498 0335, while a caller in the UK would dial 00-994-12-498 0335. (The area code for Baku is 12.)
For calls within Azerbaijan but outside the caller's area code, the caller would not dial an international access number or country code, but dial the trunk prefix (in this case 0) then the area code, followed by the telephone number. So, for instance, to call the American embassy in Baku from Ganja, Azerbaijan, a caller would dial 012-498 0335.
For a local call (that is, a call in Azerbaijan within the caller's area code) one simply dials the local number: 498 0335.

Area codes in Azerbaijan[edit]
On August 1, 2011, Azerbaijan reorganized its national numbering plan for area codes.[1] Only the area codes of Baku, Sumqayit, and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (area codes 12, 18 and 36) remain unchanged. The following tables list both the old and new area codes.

The Bahrain Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA)[1] is a governmental institution which regularly updates and publishes reports on the country's national numbering plan. The reports include all the number blocks[2] used in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
Telephone numbers in Bahrain are generally eight digits long with the exception of short codes which have fewer digits. Majority of the fixed land line numbers start with 1. Cellular (Mobile) phone numbers and pager numbers start with 3* or 663* or 669* depending on the service provider.
There is no area code in Bahrain, however the two digit numbers after the land line prefixes represent different cities or regions in Bahrain.
Batelco[3] is the main service provider for land lines. Mobile users commonly subscribe to Batelco, Zain[4] or STC.[5]

Telephone area codes in Belarus (+375 XXXX12345)
Belarus began using its own country code +375 in 1995, replacing the +7 international country code inherited from the Soviet Union.[1] The local numbering plan was inherited from the Soviet Union and remains with few changes.
Geographic area codes were designed based on previous 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that. This pause was initially required by the analog trunk switches to identify the caller from PSTN for billing purposes.
When calling within Belarus, the trunk prefix must be followed by 0. In 2003, the abbreviated dialling within a single area code was replaced with a full 9-digit number + 2-digit trunk prefix. Previously it was possible to dial 82RRnn-nnn to reach a number in the same area. Now it is required to dial 80~AARRnn-nnn where AA is the area code, RR is the region code and nn-nnn is the local number.
International calling remains unchanged: 8~10-xxx...xxxx where 8 is a trunk prefix, 10 is the international access code, xxx...xxxx are the digits of the destination country, areas and local number.


New numbering plan[edit]
This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (September 2023)
Beltelecom began transition to the international numbering standard similar to the one adapted in many European countries in 2007. March 31, 2007 all short numbers were changed from 2 or 3 digits to 3 digits starting with 1.
Beltelecom plans to change trunk prefix to 0 from current 8~0 and international prefix to 00 from current 8~10.

Telephone numbers in BelgiumLocationCountryBelgiumContinentEuropeTypeOpenFormat0x xxx xx xx / 0xx xx xx xx (geographic)  04xx xx xx xx (mobile)Access codesCountry code+32International access00Long-distance0
A telephone number in Belgium is a sequence of nine or ten digits dialed on a telephone to make a call on the Belgian telephone network.  Belgium is under a full number dialing plan, meaning that the full national number must be dialed for all calls, while it retains the trunk code, '0', for all national dialling.
Exception: Some "special services" use 3 or 4 digits with no area or trunk codes: e.g.; 112 and 100 (fire brigade and ambulance); 101 (police); 1307 (info in French) or 1207 (info in Dutch), etc.
"112" is an emergency number for contacting the fire brigade, ambulance and police in all 27 countries of the European Union. Operators will help the caller in the country's native language, in English, or the language of any neighbouring country.
Calls to this number for contacting the police are forwarded to "101", losing response time.
The telephone numbering plan allows for numbers have varying lengths (9 digits for landline numbers, and 10 digits for mobile numbers).


Overview and structure[edit]
Area codes in Belgium are, excluding the leading '0', one or two digits long. Numbers are of variable length; landlines have a seven-digit subscriber number and a one-digit area code for large cities, while smaller cities have a six-digit subscriber number and a two-digit area code. All Belgian telephone numbers dialed within Belgium must use the leading '0' trunk code. Area codes are separated from the subscriber number by a slash and a space, and subscriber number digits are in the format xxx xx xx or xx xx xx (sometimes xxx xxx), depending on the length of the area code. See the table below for examples:

Belgium
  0x xxx xx xx - dialing a big city, such as Brussels, Antwerp, Liège and Ghent.
 0xx  xx xx xx - dialing a small city, such as Kortrijk, Mons, Ostend, Aalst or Verviers
04xx  xx xx xx - dialing a mobile number from a landline or another mobile phone.

Remark that Liège shares the trunk number 04 for landlines with the mobile numbers prefix 046, 047, 048, or 049. But landlines in Liège do not start with those sequences.
From outside Belgium, a caller would dial their international call prefix (typically 00 in Europe and 011 in North America), followed by 32 (the country code for Belgium), then the area code minus the trunk code '0', and finally the local number.

Dialing from New York to Brussels
011-32-2-555-12-12 - Omitting the leading "0".

Dialing from New York to Charleroi
011-32-71-123-456 - The subscriber number shortens with the addition of a number to the area code.

Dialing from New York to a mobile number
011-32-4xx-12-34-56 - The dialer omits the leading "0".

Mobile/GSM area codes always begin with 04xx and the subscriber number is six digits long. Numbers are usually provided by Orange (formerly Mobistar), Base, or Proximus, and more recently by Telenet as well. Each provider has a unique number assigned as the second digit in the area code: Proximus numbers begin with 047x or 0460, Base numbers with 048x, Orange numbers with 049x and Telenet numbers with 0467 and 0468. With the introduction of number portability, both for landlines and mobile numbers, area codes may no longer correspond with their original providers or local switches.

The PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) with “0” as second digit, and mobile numbers with “0”or “2” as second digit, are restricted from accepting collect calls.

Changes in 2002[edit]
National numbering plan[edit]
The revised national numbering plan was designed and designated with:

+CCC + NDC + SN or +CCC + ZNY + XXXX
where:

CCC = Country Code
ZNY = National Destination Code (NDC)
Z = (1 – 9) Geographic or District Code
N = (0 – 9) User Group / Platform Code
Y = (0 – 9) (Carry over first digit from existing and virtual five-digit number – YXXXX)
XXXX = Subscriber Number (SN) [(0)0000 – (9)9999]
Assignment[edit]
+CCC + ZNY + XXXX
ZNY where:
Z = Geographic or district code (1 – 9)

0 – Reserved
1 – Reserved
2 – Belize District
3 – Orange Walk District
4 – Corozal District
5 – Stann Creek District
6 – Countrywide Mobile Roaming by all mobile service providers
7 – Toledo District
8 – Cayo District (including Belmopan, San Ignacio and Benque Viejo)
9 – Reserved
N = User Group/Platform classification/Identification for the respective service providers, where N = 0 – 9
For example:

0 = PrePay (e.g. Prepaid/Pay phone for a specified service provider)
1 = Mobile (e.g. Mobile for a specific service provider)
2 = PSTN (e.g. Public Switched Telecommunication Network for a specific service provider)
3 = Reserved
4 = Reserved
5 = Reserved
6 = Reserved
7 = Reserved
8 = Reserved
9 = Reserved
Y = First digit of a virtual five-digit subscriber number and/or first digit of present five-digit subscriber numbers – (0 – 9)
XXXX = Subscriber numbers (0000 – 9999)

Potential numbers with 0000 and 9999 will be reserved
Assigned numbers will start from 00010
Assigned numbers will stop at 99998
Subscribers/Customers will be required to dial seven (7) digits for all local calls whether within the same area or district or to another area or district.
Application and examples[edit]
Present number for

Customer in Belize City – 02 24940
Belmopan – 08 22692
Service being provided by BTL’s – PSTN
New number

Belize City – 222 4940
Belmopan – 822 2692
Middle digit “2” identifies BTL’s Public Switch Telecommunication Network (PSTN).
Present number for

Customer in Belize City – 02 24940
Belmopan – 08 22692
Service being provided by the PSTN of another service provider
New Number

Belize City – 242 4940
Belmopan – 842 2692
Middle digit “4” identifies other service provider’s Public Switch Telecommunication Network (PSTN).
Mobile Cellular

Belize Telecommunication Ltd present number: 0149076
New number will be 614 9076 – Country wide.
Number digit “1” identifies Belize Telecommunication Ltd.
Mobile cellular service by another service provider for same subscriber will be 654 9076.
Number digit “5” identifies the other service provider.
The choice of dialling the middle digit “1” or middle digit “5” will be that of the consumer and would be based on service cost and interconnection arrangements.
Changes prior to spring 1996[edit]
Approx 1996 to April 2002[edit]
As of early 1996, AT&T and other reliable sources indicated that Belize had recently changed its switching arrangements for incoming international calls so that all locations in the country required an area code to be dialed.
The area codes were still of varying length, followed by numbers of a more fixed length than before.  Belize City now required an area code of 2 in order to be dialed, while the digit 0 was deleted from all other area codes when calling from outside the country.
Belize City was 2, Caye Caulker was 22, Ladyville was 25, San Pedro was 26, Burrell Boom was 28, and other outlying areas around Belize City were 21.  Presumably, no Belize City number would begin with 1, 2, 5, 6 or 8 in order to avoid confusion in the switch (e.g. 28-8012 could be mistaken as 2-88012).

Pre-1996 (approximate)[edit]
Prior to this change, and starting at least no later than 1980, Belize City was dialed as +501 then the local five digit number.  Other locations were dialed as +501, then an area code starting with 0, then the local number.  The arrangement indicated that incoming international calls reached the Belize City exchange, from which a further call was dialed as if the international caller was in Belize City.
The telephone network was developed during the late 1960s and 1970s with installation of modern exchanges to replace older networks, and to tie them together into a long-distance network using area codes.  Neither the local numbers nor the area codes were of standard length, though larger towns tended to have a single digit after the 0.
Rural areas outside of a town usually had a separate area code, longer than that of the town, but beginning with the same digit.
For example, Orange Walk Town was 03, but its suburbs and outlying area was 031; no Orange Walk telephone number would begin with 1.

History[edit]
Bosnia and Herzegovina once was a part of Yugoslavia. While the international prefix for Yugoslavia was +38, places in Bosnia and Herzegovina were assigned phonecodes (and postcodes) beginning with 7 and 8. If the phonecode of a city was 0xx, the appropriate postcode was xx000. These postcodes are still valid.
Note: the codes listed below are now all obsolete. However, they are still used at times to identify places in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly 071 (Sarajevo), 078 (Banja Luka) and 075 (Tuzla).

Fixed line numbers in Botswana are seven digits long in a closed telephone numbering plan, with the geographical area being indicated by the first two or three digits, meaning that there are no area codes. The country was allocated its own country code by the International Telecommunication Union, +267, in the late 1960s.[1]


Calling formats[edit]
xx xxxxx or xxx xxxxx – calling within Botswana
+267 xx xxxxx or +267 xxx xxxxx – calling from outside Botswana
The NSN length is seven digits for fixed lines, and eight digits for VoIP and mobile ranges.
Until the 1990s, calls to Botswana could be made from South Africa using the regional code 0192.[2]

The Brazilian telephone numbering plan uses a two-digit area code plus eight-digit local phone numbers for landlines and nine digits for mobile lines.[1][2][3] Public utility services use short phone numbers (usually three digits), always starting with 1.[4]


Local dialing[edit]
As established by ANATEL, the Brazilian federal telecommunications regulatory agency, the format for a local phone number is nnnn-nnnn (eight digits) for landlines, and nnnnn-nnnn (nine digits) for mobile lines. The first digits of the local number identify the service associated with the phone number:

1: special short public utility numbers (see below)
2 to 5: landlines
6 to 8: Unused (iDEN was disestablished in 2018)
91000 to 99999: mobile phones
0 is reserved for long-distance calls and cannot be used as a local initial digit (see below). 901 to 909 have been reserved for automated system of national collect calls (see below) since 1982 and cannot be used a local initial digits. 900 was used to premium-rate telephone numbers in the 1990s, but is not in use now.
Until the 1990s, there were also certain regions in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul with three-digit area codes and five (n-nnnn) or six-digit (nn-nnnn) phone numbers. In the city of São Paulo, although the area code has two digits, there were still six-digit telephone in use; 3X-nnnn phone numbers (with X=4 to 7) changed to 60X-nnnn and then to 310X-nnnn, 9X-nnnn phone numbers (with X=2 or 3) changed to 69X-nnnn and then to 669X-nnnn (today 269X-nnnn), and 6n-nnnn phone numbers which were changed directly to the eight-digit format (nnnn-nnnn) at that time. Even shorter numbers used to exist in previous decades, especially in small towns and before direct distance dialing became universal.
In the late 1990s, the 7-digit landline numbers beginning with 9 in the area of DDD 11 also had their prefixes changed, and their numbers were replaced in most cases by prefixes beginning with 69 (now 29) or 64 (now 24) in the cities of São Paulo and Guarulhos respectively.
Landlines using prefixes beginning with 8 and 7 had their prefixes changed up to 2000 and 2001 respectively for 8-digit numbers, and new area codes 22, 28, 64, 66, 87, 88, 89, 93, 94, 97 and 99 are included at this time.
Until 2005, some localities still used seven-digit local numbers (nnn-nnnn), such numbers being changed to eight digits (nnnn-nnnn).
Except in the case of the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the numbers of 7-digit landlines were given the number 3 preceding the old number, and the numbers of 7-digit mobile phones were given the number 9 preceding old number between late 90's until the inclusion of the ninth digit.
In the state of Rio de Janeiro, only the 7-digit numbers beginning with 3 and 8 received the 3 preceding the old number, while the other numbers received the number 2 preceding the old number.
In the interior and litoral of the state of São Paulo, in many cases the old prefix of 7-digit numbers have been completely changed, but this numbers standardized with an 8-digit number starting at 3 in landlines and 9 in mobiles until the inclusion of the ninth digit.
In the Greater São Paulo and neighborhood cities using DDD 11, the cities today uses numbers initializing with 2, 3, 4 or 5, with the prefixes started in 2 are used mainly in São Paulo and Guarulhos, started in 3 mainly in São Paulo and Osasco, started in 4 used mainly in the metropolitan region and started in 5 used exclusively in numbers allocated to the city of São Paulo except 57 numbers, allocated for rural landline numbers.
Numbers beginning with 8 are reserved for mobile phones and numbers beginning with 7 after change of prefixes started for this number in 2001 were initially reserved for trunking, however they were later also intended for mobile phones.
Until 2008, the initial digit 6 was used for landlines in some parts of São Paulo and neighbouring cities in area code 11, but Anatel required that 6 be released for mobile use. Fixed-line numbers starting with 6 in that area were gradually changed during 2008 to new prefixes starting with 2. In other areas of Brazil, the initial digit 6 was not in use at that time, so no change was necessary because at this time landlines used prefixes beginning with 2, 3 or 4 outside the Greater São Paulo region.[5]
Exceptionally, at the beginning of the 2010s, cell phones with a prefix starting at 5 were enabled in Greater São Paulo, and in this transition period, which anticipated the inclusion of the ninth digit (9) preceding the old cell phone numbers, the telephony used intercept messages to indicate that calls to such numbers were being directed to mobile phone numbers.
Today, landline numbers usually use the number 3 at the beginning of the number. The use of the initial digit 2 is occasional except in Greater São Paulo and the state of Rio de Janeiro. The use of initial digit 4 is also occasional except in Greater São Paulo and digit 5 is only used in São Paulo and rural landlines using 57 prefix.
Numbers in the 300n and 400n format are commonly used by companies to provide customer service using local numbers. (see below)
Numbers starting with 1500 and 1700 are used by some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide dial-up Internet access. Those ISPs have special pricing agreements with local landline operators and customers are charged less than the price of regular local calls when calling such dial-up access numbers.
Local directory assistance can be obtained by dialing 102, but the service is charged as a regular local call in most instances except from payphones. However, all local landline telephone companies offer on-line directory inquiries on their Web sites. Mobile lines are not available for inquiry, for privacy and security reasons.

Mobile telephony[edit]
Mobile phone numbers in Brazil are assigned the same geographic area codes as fixed lines, according to the subscriber's place of residence or most frequent use. Until the inclusion of the ninth digit, mobile phone numbers start with the digits 6, 7, 8 or 9. These initial digits are known to the public, so one always knows beforehand if one is calling a fixed or a mobile line.
After replacing the landline numbers that started in 7 in 2001 (with 7 or 8-digits in Greater São Paulo and 7-digits in other regions), these numbers were initially reserved exclusively for radiophone use (iDEN technology), but soaring demand for new mobile numbers eventually forced unused number ranges starting with 7 to be released for general mobile use.
Historically, at the time mobile numbers had seven or eight digits, the higher ranges of the 9 initial digit (96-99) were originally assigned to the old state monopolies before the privatization of Brazil's telephony system, and later to their privatized direct successors. In order to create a competitive market, later the Brazilian government auctioned further mobile service licenses, filling the available number ranges backwards - first with the lower ranges of 9 (91-95), then 8, and so on.
As a consequence, in the beginning 9 (today 99) was more commonly assigned to mobile operators that used older technologies such as AMPS (analog), TDMA and CDMA, while for some time 8 (today 98) was specifically reserved for all new GSM licenses. Now GSM is universally adopted by Brazilian mobile operators and, combined with number portability and the inclusion of a ninth digit to the left (see below), this distinction is no longer observed or meaningful.

Ninth digit for mobile numbers[edit]
Brazilian mobile phone numbers always have nine digits now, but seven digits were usual in the first years, then eight digits became the standard for several years. The last area code to convert fully from seven to eight digits was 61 (comprising the national capital city, Brasília, and neighbouring areas), in 2005.
However, the popularity of multiple-SIM mobile phones in Brazil makes the country have more active mobile lines than inhabitants (as of November 2016, 248 million vs. 206 million),[6][7] and by 2010 the country's most populous and economically important area code, 11 of metropolitan São Paulo (an area where over 20 million people live), was getting close to exhausting its available mobile numbers. Overlays and extra area codes were considered, but deemed confusing and impractical for local conditions.
So, on 10 December 2010, ANATEL announced the inclusion of a ninth digit (in the format 9nnnn-nnnn) to mobile phone numbers used in the São Paulo metropolitan region (area code 11). This change was meant to increase the numbering capacity in metropolitan São Paulo from 44 million to 370 million, thereby eliminating the perennial shortage of available numbers in that area.[8]
Telecom providers would have 24 months to implement the ability to dial a new digit to the left of all cell phone numbers of area code 11,[8] but the measure ended up being implemented a few months ahead of that initial schedule, on 29 July 2012. On that date, the digit 9 was added to the left of all existing mobile numbers in the 11 area code, regardless of their former initial digits. So, for example, mobile number (11) 6010-2030 became (11) 96010-2030.[9]
In order to standardize the mobile numbering plan in Brazil, ANATEL started gradually rolling out the change to nine digits in other area codes and states as well. The last three states to implement the ninth digit in mobile numbers (the Southern states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, corresponding to area codes 41 through 55) did so on 6 November 2016.[2] Initial digits 6 through 8 remain reserved for mobile lines, but as of September 2020 all mobile numbers in Brazil still start with 9 after the ninth digit was added, and it was not yet necessary to use the other reserved initial digits.
Landline numbers (starting with 2, 3, 4 or 5) and trunked radio mobile telephony (iDEN) numbers were not changed and remained with eight digits. As iDEN numbers had the same format as the former 8-digit regular mobile numbers, and some old 8-digit standard mobile numbers also used the initial digit 7 of iDEN numbers, some confusion happened for some time, with people adding an initial 9 when calling iDEN numbers, which would not allow the call to be placed. This is no longer a problem, as iDEN service was discontinued on 31 May 2018. On that date, users who still had iDEN phones had to replace them with standard phones with GSM/3G/4G network support, and the number with one in 9-digit format.
Despite this fact, mobile phones registered outside the 11-19 (São Paulo), 21, 22, 24 (Rio de Janeiro) and 27-28 (Espírito Santo) areas are usually displayed on WhatsApp (widely used by Brazilians to send text, voice and video messages due to the privileged access granted by mobile operators, in contrast to the assumption of network neutrality present in the Marco Civil da Internet) with the old 8-digit number.

Public utility[edit]
The format for public utility service phone numbers is 1nn.[4] It includes all emergency (as well as some non-emergency) services, such as:

100: Human Rights Secretariat
112: universal emergency number for all GSM phones (redirects to 190)
128: standard emergency number in Mercosul (in Brazil, redirects to 190)
136: Ministry of Health hotline
147: Digital television transition hotline (2010–2023)
153: Municipal Guards
181: anonymous crime reporting (some areas only, others may use different, more miscellaneous numbers)
188: Centro de Valorização da Vida (Suicide prevention helpline)
190: Military Police
191: Federal Highway Police
192: ambulance
193: firefighters
194: Federal Police Department
197: Civil Police
198: state Highway Patrol
199: Civil Defense
911: emergency number in the United States (redirects to 190) [10]
Most citizens only know the 190 (Military Police) number for emergencies, but 192 (ambulance), 193 (firefighters) and 199 (civil defense) are also commonly known. Usually a call to 190 (military police) describing an emergency with a non-criminal nature will be redirected to the proper number or provide assistance if they are qualified to (as in cases of choking children).
By law, 136 is printed on the packaging of all tobacco products sold in Brazil, so it is usually thought to be just a smoking cessation help hotline. That hotline does exist and can be accessed by this number, but 136 is actually a more comprehensive contact channel between citizens and the Ministry of Health.
In 2013, a law was approved that added two new numbers, 112 and 911, to mimic the emergency numbers from European countries and United States, respectively. A call to those numbers is redirected to the same lines as 190. The law was made because of the large number of foreign tourists expected for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, so the redirecting numbers were initially reachable only from the 12 World Cup host cities, but later the change was extended to the entire country.[11]
Some states and municipalities may have additional short 1nn public utility numbers for other services. For example, in many cities, such as São Paulo,[12] one can get information, make requests and complaints about most services and issues with the municipal administration by dialing 156. Regional utilities for services such as electricity and water supply may also have short access numbers starting with 1. In contrast to emergency numbers, which are always toll-free, calls to such services may or may not be charged.
Landline telephone companies' customer service numbers have been normalized as 103, followed by a two-digit code. For example, Embratel customers contact the company's customer service dialing 103-21.[13] For most mobile carriers, the number is 105, followed by a one-digit code (e.g., 105-2 for Claro).
For cable and satellite television operators, the number is 106, followed by a two-digit code (e.g., 106-21 for Net and 106-11 for SKY Brasil).

Long-distance dialing[edit]

The Brazilian system for long-distance dialing is relatively unusual and somewhat confusing, insofar as the choice of long-distance carrier determines the actual digit sequence to be dialed.
The standard format for writing down — but not for calling since 1999 — a long-distance phone number in Brazil is (aa) nnnn-nnnn, where aa is the area code and nnnn-nnnn is the local phone number. Due to persistence of old habits from the time when carrier codes were not used (see below), the format (0aa) nnnn-nnnn is still commonly seen, but this usage is discouraged, since it may confuse customers when actually calling, despite the mobile carriers give the option to complete the call with the old dialing (0aa) nnnn-nnnn with their own code in the configuration of the GSM/UMTS/HSPA/LTE SIM cards sold in the country. Area codes are distributed geographically. See the list of Brazilian area codes for a full list.
For billing purposes, calls from mobile telephones are considered local when destined to a number belonging to the area where the cell phone is operating, while in the case of fixed telephones, such area is divided into a series of subdivisions into local areas, where only calls destined to the same city or metropolitan area are billed as local.
For other calls from landlines and mobiles, it is necessary to use the provider selection code, known as CSP, a two-digit number where none of the digits can be zero and is generally limited to one number per provider.
In such cases, it is usually necessary to dial a 0 followed by the CSP and area code before the phone number.
The need for carrier code placement began in 1999 for landlines and around 2004 for older TDMA/CDMA networks. In GSM networks, the use of the CSP was mandatory from the beginning and in the old iDEN networks and in some VOIP networks, the CSP is not used.
iDEN is discontinued, but in exceptional cases of VOIP networks that do not work with the CSP, dialing in the old mode (0 followed by the area code before the phone number) or in the international mode (+55 followed by the area code before the phone number) is the applicable mode.

Carrier selection[edit]
To dial a long-distance number within Brazil, one needs to use a carrier selection code, in order to choose which long-distance carrier will be used. The carrier selection code is specified before the area code; so, to actually place a call, one should dial 0-xx-aa-nnnn-nnnn, where xx is the two-digit carrier selection code. Because of that, sometimes long-distance phone numbers are written down as (0xxaa) nnnn-nnnn, with two actual letters x as placeholders, which the caller will replace by a carrier code.
For example, to call the number 2345-6789 in Rio de Janeiro (area code 21) using the long-distance carrier TIM (selection code 41), one would dial 0 41 21 2345 6789.
The use of carrier selection codes can be very confusing, because of the obvious added complexity, the different rates charged by different carriers, and even which long-distance carriers can be used to place the call, since not all of them service the entire Brazilian territory, and some are only available from mobile or from VoIP lines. For example, Claro (selection code 21) is available from any telephone line in all of Brazil, but Sercomtel (code 43) only in Londrina and some neighbouring cities.
Some examples of carrier selection codes are:

12 Algar Telecom
14 Oi (formerly Brasil Telecom)
15 Vivo
21 Claro (formerly Embratel)
23 Intelig Telecom
25 GVT
31 Oi (formerly Telemar)
41 TIM
43 Sercomtel
65 CGB Voip Informática e Comunicação
Area codes in Brazil are popularly known as "DDD codes" (códigos DDD) or simply "DDD", from the initials of "direct distance dialing" (discagem direta à distância in Portuguese). This was how the service was first advertised when it first appeared in the late 1960s, and the name stuck.
As of January 2009, Embratel is the only carrier offering operator-assisted long-distance calls, by dialing 0800-703-2110. Long-distance directory inquiries can be made dialing 0800-703-2100. However, subscriber numbers can also be obtained by a search at the destination telephone company's website. See the "External links" section below for a useful site with links to Brazilian directory assistance pages.

Collect calls[edit]
In Brazil, collect calls are automated. The phone number to be called is prefixed with a special code. Then, as the person being called answers the telephone, they listen to a short standard recording informing them that it is a collect call. Next, the call is established and the caller is supposed to say their name and location within the next six seconds. If the person being called hangs up within those six initial seconds, nothing is charged. Otherwise, the remaining time of the call is charged to the recipient's phone line.
This used to cause problems with answering machines and faxes, but the switch to digital voice mailboxes operated by the telephone companies largely eliminated that problem. Also, the widespread use of caller ID combined with the easily recognizable electronic tune played before the collect-call warning makes many people hang up immediately if they hear the tune and the number has not been recognized.
Local collect calls are dialed with the 9090 prefix; so, to call nnnn-nnnn collect, one would dial 9090-nnnn-nnnn.
To collect calls for long-distance numbers, one should dial 9 before 0-xx-aa-nnnn-nnnn, but not all numbers receipt this calls.
For example, to call the mobile number 98999-6666 registered in Ribeirão Preto region (area code 16) outside of this area using the long-distance carrier Vivo (selection code 15), one would dial 9 0 15 16 98999 6666.
International collect calls, for countries for which it is available, are not automated and must be placed through Embratel's international operator, dialing 0800-703-2111. One can also call an English-speaking AT&T operator directly by dialing 0800-890-0288.

Non-geographic numbers[edit]
Non-geographic numbers usually have a three-digit prefix and a 7-digit number, preceded by the number 0 used for long distance calls. The second digit of non-geographic number prefixes is the number 0, and the number is usually disclosed for national calls in the form 0a0b-nnn-nnnn and is occasionally disclosed in the international format for whatsapp contacts in the form +55 a0b-nnn-nnnn.
Some 0800 numbers are 6-digit only, being that such lines generally have high user traffic. Because of this fact, despite having activated a new 7-digit number, it still keeps the 6-digit number initially assigned active. For example, Ministry of Education has 0800-61-6161/0800-061-6161.
The currently allocated prefixes are:

0300: premium-rate telephone numbers initially with higher rates than local calls, but with lower rates than the long distance calls of the basic plan, charged separately from the call package.
0303: Initially used for televoting, it had a fee similar to 0300. Today it is used for identifying telemarketing calls.
0304: Telephone numbers intended to identify collection centers.
0500: premium-rate telephone numbers for charity donations, with a maximum of R$ 30.00 per donation (the telephone number is assigned to a donation value) + R$ 0.50 for call costs.
0800: toll-free telephone numbers.
0801: Telecard - Call service where the charge for a call from a payphone was charged to the account of a landline subscriber traveling. Service commonly used in the 90s, but discontinued, although when dialing from payphones, the four digits of the password related to the telecard still appear hidden in the device after dialing the prefix and the two digits assigned to the operator with which the Telecard was related.
0900: premium-rate telephone numbers at rates much higher than those charged on national calls. After problems due to charges considered abusive by consumers in the 90s and early 2000s, the service is rarely used today.
"3/400n-nnnn" numbers[edit]
A special case of non-geographic numbers are eight-digit numbers in the form 3/400n-nnnn. They are dialed as local numbers, without any trunk, carrier or area codes, and calls to them are always charged as local, regardless of where the answering call center physically is. In spite of this, there are some 300x/400x prefixes that direct calls as locations only in a specific geographic area within the area of operation of the company operating the service, or may even be used as typical local numbers.
Such numbers differ from 0300 numbers in that the latter in the past were not charged as local calls and had their own rates (not always really flat and sometimes more like premium-rate numbers), which by law must be informed when advertising the number. 0300 numbers are often used, for example, by low-cost airlines' reservation systems, whereas 400n-nnnn numbers are used by large but cost-conscious companies that do not wish to bear the full cost of a nationwide toll-free system, yet still do not want their customers to be put away by having to pay long-distance rates, and the "national" number system in these cases is based on the same number being contracted in all DDD areas of the country or eventually only in the areas where the company has the focus of its activity.. 3/400n-nnnn numbers are also often used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for standard dial-up access.
As of January 2009, 3/400n-nnnn numbers are not yet available for access from all area codes or localities due to the division of the cities in the DDD areas into local subareas generally limited to the municipality or the conurbated metropolitan area, requiring the typing of 0-xx-aa to call the number from landlines in the municipalities outside the local subarea to which the number special is associated. As a result, these numbers are associated with state capitals and their metropolitan regions or the largest city in the area. The company (especially in the case of ISPs) may also specify localities where the service will or will not be available, providing an alternative long-distance or toll-free number for such cases. For example, the country's largest bank, Banco do Brasil, offers the number 4004-0001 for its clients to access its home banking services in major cities (where most clients are) paying local rates, and the toll-free number 0800-729-0001 for clients elsewhere in the country.
Example: In area 19 the prefix 4001 was located to Metropolitan Region of Campinas, therefore:

To call the number (19) 4001-2234 from a landline in Vinhedo (part of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas): 4001 2234
To call the number (19) 4001-3579 from a payphone in Piracicaba (within area 19, but outside the metropolitan region of Campinas): 0 XX 19 4001 3579
To call the number (19) 4001-3456 from a cell phone working in Rio Claro (also outside the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, but also in area 19): 4001 3456
As explained, it is not necessary to dial the prefix 0-XX-AA from cell phones in the same area with which the destination number is associated, but it may be necessary to dial such prefix from landlines and payphones.

International calls[edit]
Outbound[edit]
Outbound international calls use a 00 trunk prefix, followed by the carrier selection code (same as in domestic long-distance calls) and the international telephone number. So, to call the international telephone number +cc-aa-nnnn-nnnn (where cc is the country code and aa the area code), one would dial 00-xx-cc-aa-nnnn-nnnn, where xx is the carrier selection code. Since international telephone numbers can have up to 15 digits, the maximum number of digits to be dialed is 19.
For example, to call the number 555-0123 in Washington, D.C. (area code 202), United States (country code 1), using TIM as the chosen carrier (selection code 41), one would dial 00 41 1 202 555 0123.
Again, selecting a carrier can be tricky, since they charge different rates, not all of them operate in all of Brazil, not all forward international calls, and some do not put calls through to some remote or rarely called countries.
There is a special exception for foreign visitors who are using international roaming in Brazil. They can use the standard dialing format to call abroad from Brazil (+cc-aa-nnnn-nnnn).
As of August 2016, Embratel was the only carrier offering operator-assisted international calls, by dialing 0800-703-2111. International telephone number inquiries can be made dialing 0800-703-2100 (same number as for domestic directory inquiries).[14] Embratel also offers radio calls to sea vessels in Brazilian waters by dialing 0800-701-2141,[15] in addition to INMARSAT service, which works like any regular international call and can be placed through any major long-distance carrier.

Inbound[edit]
Inbound international calls use +55 aa nnnn nnnn as the international telephone number, where aa is the two-digit Brazilian area code and nnnn nnnn is the 8-digit local number (9 digits for mobile numbers). This must be preceded by an international call prefix specific to the country where the call is being placed from (e.g., 011 from the U.S. and Canada, 00 from most other countries, or the actual "+" sign from many mobile networks). If the number in Brazil was supplied with an initial 0 and/or carrier selection codes, those must be omitted.
For example, to call the number 3210-9876 in São Paulo (area code 11) from the United States, one would dial 011 55 11 3210 9876.

Number portability[edit]
In September 2008, ANATEL started the use of number portability in Brazilian territory, but the existing rules of the numbering plan were kept. Fixed-line customers can keep their numbers when moving their address and/or when switching telephone companies within the same municipality, and mobile lines customers can keep their numbers provided they stay within the same local area (i.e., the portion of the area code where calls are charged as local).[16]

Telephone numbers in BulgariaLocationCountryBulgariaContinentEuropeNSN  length8 (9 for mobile numbers)Format(02) xxx xxxx (Sofia)(0xx) xx xxxx(0xxx) xxxxx(0xxxx) xxxx08z xxx xxxx (mobiles)0800 xxxxx (freephone)Access codesCountry code+359International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Bulgaria are under a full number dialing plan, meaning that the full national number must be dialed for all calls, while it retains the trunk code, '0', for all national dialling. Area codes are prefixed with a trunk code of 0 only when dialled domestically.
For example, to call a number in Sofia, dial:

02 xxx xxxx from a landline in Sofia
02 xxx xxxx from outside Sofia but in Bulgaria
+359 2 xxx xxxx from outside Bulgaria

Fixed-line numbers[edit]
Domestic numbers are limited to eight digits in length. Area codes vary in length from one to five digits. Subscriber number lengths vary accordingly, from seven digits down to three digits. Sofia lines on digital switches have seven-digit numbers, those on analog switches had six; in Plovdiv, Varna and Ruse both are six digits; and in most other province capitals lines on digital switches have six-digit numbers and analog had five.
For a very long time, the state-owned Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) had a monopoly on fixed telephone networks. However, this ended when a special law was adopted. BTC was privatized in 2004 and competing operators appeared.
Larger areas, such as Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, and Burgas, are subdivided into zones. Although one cannot further reduce the number of dialed digits, the number itself shows which zone it is located in. For example, in Sofia, numbers starting with 2, 82, 92 are located in the Western suburbs, 7, 87, 97 in the Eastern suburbs, and 98 in the central area.
Around 2010[when?], the intensive process of replacing the old analog switches with modern digital ones completed. In some areas it is even possible to guess if a subscriber number was changed from analog to digital during its existence or was subscribed as digital initially. For example, in Blagoevgrad a number starting with 88 was subscribed as digital, and a number starting with a single 8 was analog before.
The first digit also shows if a particular subscriber number is operated by BTC or another operator.
The area codes are always cited with the trunk code. When dialing all subscriber numbers must be prefixed with trunk and area code except short codes (see below). Numbers starting with 700, 800 and 90x as well as mobile ones are prefixed by '0' only. However, when dialing from abroad, the trunk code '0' must be replaced with the country code '+359'.

Mobile numbers[edit]
This article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (August 2015)
Until 20 July 2003 GSM networks used six-digit subscriber numbers in accordance with the limit of eight digits for the domestic part of a number. With the increase of subscribers (and an international requirement), all (except Vivacom, which started operations in 2006) acquired new access codes. On 20 July 2003, Mobiltel used three codes ((0)87, (0)88, (0)89) and Globul used two ((0)98 and (0)99). When these limits were also to be overwhelmed, seven-digit subscriber numbers and single access codes per operator were introduced, hence M-tel (now A1) reverted to 088 (+7 digits) only, while Globul (now Yettel) took the old M-tel code 089 (+7 digits), and the rest were freed up. (Mobikom had gone through a similar change in the mid-90s – from (0)799 to (0)48).
This change provokes an error in citing mobile numbers, quite similar to that of erroneous UK telephone codes. The first digit of the subscriber number is most often cited as part of the access code, e.g. (0)887 XXX XXX, instead of the correct (0)88 7XX XXXX. This error remains for new subscriber numbers even for Vivacom (which entered the market with the 087 (+7 digits) code and has always remained so). However, unlike the situation in UK, this error has no effect since a mobile number must always be dialled with the access code.
Dialing to a mobile network requires the access code together with the 0. Dialing from a mobile network requires either an area or access code with the trunk or international format ((0)YY YXXX XXX or +359 YY YXXX XXX). The latter becomes a normal practice, since most people use number lists of their handsets, more people use their phones in roaming and all four operators show the caller ID in international format.
The number 088 8888 888 (formerly 0888 888 888 or +359 88 888 8888) was linked to three deaths in the early 2000s,[1] leading M-tel to suspend use of the number from service.

Area codes[edit]
As in many countries, an area code is often written with the dialing code 0 pretended as if it were part of the area code itself.

Telephone numbers in CambodiaLocationCountryCambodiaContinentAsiaTypeOpenFormat0XX-XXX-XXX0XX-XXX-XXXXAccess codesCountry code+855International access00XLong-distance0

International Calls[edit]
International Access Codes are also used to select the operator. All are starting with 00 while the third number is identifying the operators gateway. Currently there are 3 active codes:

Gateway 1 (MPTC or Telecom Cambodia) - 001
Gateway 2 (Royal Telecam International) - 007
VoIP Gateway - 008
All other combinations are reserved for this purpose only.[1]


Land Lines[edit]
To dial a land line in Cambodia all over the country, the format is Area Code + Phone Number. The area code is 3 digits long, followed by a 6 or 7 digit phone number.
Calls made from outside Cambodia must omit the prefix 0. Therefore, to call a land line number in Phnom Penh from other countries, dialing begins with +855 23 followed by 6 or 7 digits.[2]

Stung Treng - 074
Ratanakiri - 075
Likewise to call mobile phones from land line or other mobile phones, domestic dialing begins a 0 followed by 8 or 9 digits.[3]
Mobile numbers in Cambodia take the form: 0TT-AXX-XXXY.
The first two numbers after the leading 0 or 'TT' in the example above identify the operator. For example, 010 234 567 is an example of a 9 digit mobile number from Smart. 088 234 5678 on the other hand is an example of a 10 digit mobile number from Metfone.
The 3rd digit after the leading 0 or 'A' in the example above must be between 1 and 9.[4] Normally this value is between 2 and 9 which allows a value of '1' to be used for mobile phones which are roaming in Cambodia. However some operators such as Mobitel are using a '1' in this range to extend their number ranges for certain popular prefixes. For example, 012 123 4567 and 092 123 456 are valid mobile numbers in Ca
'X' can take the values 0 to 9 and 'Y' is an optional extra digit which is used by some operators.
Most mobile numbers are 8 digits long (excluding the leading 0), however some operators are now using 9 digit numbers. 0882345678 is an example of a valid 9 digit mobile number.+85592662075
Calls made from outside Cambodia must omit the prefix 0. Therefore, to call a mobile number in Cambodia from other countries, dialing begins with +855 1, +855 8, or +855 92662075/9 etc.

Cape Verde telephone calling codes
Telephone numbers in Cape VerdeLocationCountryCape VerdeContinentAfricaAccess codesCountry code+238International access00
The following are telephone codes in Cape Verde.


Overview[edit]
Telephone numbers in Cape Verde are 7 digits long (except for special 1xx codes), and must always be dialed in their entirety (a closed dialing plan). The first 3 digits of a fixed-line (non-mobile) number correspond to its geographic area. Calls within a given 2xx area, and between certain areas, are considered local calls and priced accordingly. Mobile numbers have no geographic area, and calls to or from national mobile numbers are treated the same regardless of location.

History[edit]
On July 3 2004, 2 was prepended to all fixed-line numbers, and 9 to all mobile numbers, increasing the number length to 7 digits.[1]

Calling format[edit]
xxx xxxx - calling inside Cape Verde
+238 xxx xxxx - calling from outside Cape Verde
The NSN length is seven digits.

Numbering plan[edit]
Number ranges[edit]
In all cases listed, when a 2x range is split between two islands, one takes 2x0 through 2x4, while the other takes 2x5 through 2x9.

Telephone numbers in ChileLocationCountryChileContinentSouth AmericaRegulatorSUBTELTypeClosedNSN  length9Access codesCountry code+56International access1xx0Long-distancenone
The following telephone numbers in Chile are geographic area codes for all national and international calls terminating in Chile.


Geographic area codes[edit]
No geographic area codes exist in Chile; all calls within Chile are considered local calls. All numbers contain 9 digits and there is no difference among land-line, mobile and VoIP

Transition to area code deprecation[edit]
In 2012 and 2013, land lines were renumbered, with an additional digit 2 prepended.[1]   The change was rolled out gradually by area code; first in Santiago (Region Metropolitana) and Arica in late 2012, then throughout all remaining regions between March and July 2013.
During that transitional period, when calling a landline, area code and an extra 2 were added at the beginning of the number, or between the area code and number.  E.g. a formerly seven digit Santiago number (02) XXX XXXX became 22X XXX XXX, and a formerly six digit Punta Arenas number (061) YYY YYY became 612 YYY YYY.
The process was completed in September 2016.

Total number portability[edit]
Total number portability exists in Chile,[2] so users can freely move from one service provider to another without losing their number, regardless of connection technology, whether land-line, mobile or VoIP. Therefore, a number beginning with "8" or "9" no longer denotes that it is a mobile phone number.

Special services[edit]
There is a group of special numbers for public services, and they are in the format 1XY. The most important ones are:

130 Forest fires (Incendios forestales)
131 Ambulance (SAMU)
132 Firefighters (Bomberos)
133 Police Emergency (Emergencias Policiales)
134 Investigaciones
135 Drug usage prevention hot line (Fono drogas)[3]
136 Mountain Rescue (Cuerpo de Socorro Andino)
137 Sea Rescue (Rescate Marítimo de la Armada)
139 Police Information  (Informaciones Policiales)
147 Child abuse prevention (Fono niños)
149 Family Violence (Fono familia)
Long-distance carriers[edit]
In Chile it is necessary to choose the carrier for international long-distance calls every time and therefore to obtain the best rate for any destination. Long-distance carriers have a prefix that must be dialed when calling long distance:
XXX + 0 + country code + area + phone
The current carrier codes are:[4]

110 Claro Chile
111 VTR Chile
112 Convergia Chile
113 Transam

Map of the area codes
Telephone numbers in the People's Republic of China are administered according to the Chinese Telephone Code Plan. The structure of telephone numbers for landlines and mobile service is different. Landline telephone numbers have area codes, whereas mobile numbers do not. In major cities, landline numbers consist of a two-digit area code followed by an eight-digit local number. In other places, landline numbers consist of a three-digit area code followed by a seven- or eight-digit local number. Mobile phone numbers consist of eleven digits.
Landline calls within the same area do not require the area code. Calls to other areas require dialing the trunk prefix 0 and the area code.
Calling a mobile phone from a landline requires the addition of the "0" in front of the mobile phone number if they are not in the same area.[citation needed] Mobile to landline calls requires the "0" and the area code if the landline is not within the same place. Mobile to mobile calls does not require the "0" outside mainland China.
The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau and the disputed territories controlled by the Republic of China (Taiwan) and India are not part of this numbering plan and use the country codes 852, 853, 886 and 91 respectively.


Mobile phones[edit]
In mainland China, mobile phone numbers have eleven digits in the format 1xx-XXXX-XXXX (except for 140–144, which are 13-digit IoT numbers), in which the first three digits (13x to 19x) designate the mobile phone service provider.
Before GSM, mobile phones had 6-digit (later upgraded to 7-digit) numbers starting with nine. They had the same numbering format as fixed-line telephones. Those numbers were eventually translated into 1390xx9xxx, where xx were local identifiers.
The oldest China Mobile GSM numbers were ten digits long and started with 139 in 1994, the second oldest 138 in 1997, and 137, 136, 135 in 1999. The oldest China Unicom numbers started with 130 in 1995, the second oldest at 131 in 1998. Keeping the same number over time is somewhat associated with the stability and reliability of the owner. The 5th to the seventh digit sometimes relates to age and location.
China's mobile telephone numbers were changed from ten digits to eleven digits, with 0 added after 13x, and thus the HLR code became four-digit long to expand the capacity of the seriously fully crowded numbering plan.
In 2006, 15x numbers were introduced. In late 2008, 18x and 14x (for data plans or IoT) were introduced. In late 2013, 17x were introduced. In 2017, 16x and 19x were introduced.
In December 2016, each cell phone number was required to be consigned to a real name in mainland China.[citation needed]
In November 2010, MIIT has started the trial mobile number portability service in Tianjin and Hainan, in 2012 the trial has extended to Jiangxi, Hubei and Yunan provinces. On 10 November 2019, all provinces started accepting MNP requests for all mobile carriers, except for technical difficulties, the MVNO phones, satellite phones and IoT phones.
As of 2016, all carriers are releasing USIM cards.
Mobile service carriers can be identified by the first three or four digits as follows:

Emergency numbers[edit]
From within Mainland China, the following emergency numbers are used:

110 – Police (12110 for SMS to police, not for calling, 95110 for maritime policies[note 1], 96110 to report frauds)
119 – Fire brigade (12119 for forest fire in some regions)
120 – Ambulance
122 – Traffic accident (incorporated into 110 in some cities) (12122 on expressways)
999 – Privately operated ambulance (Beijing ONLY, calls outside Beijing is 010-999)
In most cities, the emergency numbers assist in Mandarin Chinese and English.
Starting from 2012 in Shenzhen, an implemented system upgrade to unify three emergency reporting services into one number, 110. A similar approach is being installed in more cities in China to make them more convenient.
Dialing 112, 911, and 999 (outside Beijing without area code 010) plays a recording message about the correct emergency numbers in Chinese and English twice: "For police, dial 110. To report a fire, dial 119. For ambulance, dial 120. To report a traffic accident, dial 122." on China Mobile and China Unicom phones, NO SERVICES will be redirected. The error messages "Number does not exist" will be played on China Telecom phones, and NO SERVICES will be redirected. However, some local report said that in sometimes, only within Beijing, China Unicom landlines and mobile phones call 010-112 may be successful as reporting service for call failures.

Number Plan[edit]
Colombia operates a closed dialing plan, with all fixed line and mobile subscriber numbers being 10-digit.[1]
Nationally, all calls between subscribers are dialed as ten digits, with no prefix.

History[edit]
Prior to September 2021, Colombia had fixed line subscriber numbers that comprised a single digit dialing zone and a 7-digit local number.
These were converted to the new format by inserting "60" before the dialing zone.
There were various dial plans, with different access prefixes depending on the type of service. All such prefixes have been removed, except for international calls from landlines.

Landline service[edit]
All landline subscriber numbers follow the pattern:

60B-YXX-XXXX
Where B is the dialing zone (where the number is located), 
Y is 2 to 8 (or 9 for pay phones),[2][failed verification]
and X is any digit.
Each department belongs to only one dialing zone.
Calls from landlines to both landline and mobile numbers are placed by dialing the 10-digit subscriber number with no prefix.
Calling internationally from Colombian landlines requires a carrier-selection code be included after the 00 IDD prefix, before the country code and foreign subscriber number:

00A-XX... Where XX represents the destination country dialing code and A represents one of the national long-distance carriers, but new long distance operators are using 0Axy format:

Mobile service[edit]
As with landlines, calls from mobile phones to both landline and mobile numbers are placed by dialing the 10-digit subscriber number with no prefix.
Mobile subscriber numbers follow the pattern:

3MM-XXX-XXXX
where 3MM usually indicates the one of the country's mobile phone operators.

Since Colombia adopted the mobile number portability, these 3MM codes only indicate the original operator when the subscriber obtained the number; individual subscriber numbers may use other operators.

Toll-free service[edit]
Toll-free numbers follow the pattern:

01-800-XXX-XXXX[3]
Before 2002, the format was 9800-XXXXXX. When the current format was adopted in that year, existing toll-free numbers were given the format 01-800-0XX-XXXX. These numbers were advertised with the grouping 01-8000-XX-XXX, leading many people to erroneously believe that the general prefix for toll-free numbers is 01-8000.

Other services[edit]

01-900-XXX-XXXX
01-901-XXX-XXXX

1-3-2, for only Ambulance services.

Country Code: +506
International Call Prefix: 00
Number plan type: closed
As of 2010 the government body in charge of allocations is the Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones SUTEL.[1]


History of allocations[edit]
Prefix 00 was reserved for international calls, while prefix 9 was assigned to special numbers, such as 911. Toll-free numbers start with 800 followed by 7 digits while premium-rate numbers start with 900 followed by 7 digits.
Before 1994, all phone numbers in Costa Rica were six digits long. The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, which at that time had the monopoly on telecommunications, introduced a system in which the telephone numbers in every province were assigned a prefix to make them 7 digits long.
This numbering system was effective for some time. However, the boom of mobile phone customers since the introduction of GSM around 2000 and the expansion of metropolitan areas caused a serious shortage of available numbers. Thus many GSM-based customers used numbers starting with 3 and many residents of San Jose province had telephone numbers starting with prefixes other than 2.
Since March 20, 2008, a renewed numbering system added the prefix 2 for all landlines and 8 for all mobile phone numbers. This system was implemented in order to face the introduction of 1.5 million 3G W-CDMA customers in Q1 2009. The transition to 8-digit numbers was heavily publicized in Costa Rican media. However, the change caused considerable confusion among foreigners. Also, all calls dialed using the old 7-digit version of the phone number are automatically redirected to a voice message with information about the change.
In 2010, after the end of the government monopoly in telecommunications, prefixes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were assigned to private operators.
8-digit numbers are commonly written one of two ways: "xxxxxxxx" or "xxxx-xxxx"

This is an alphabetical list by town of phone dialing codes in Croatia. The country calling code for Croatia is +385. Croatia received a new country code following the breakup of the SFR Yugoslavia (+38) in 1991.


Calling scheme[edit]
The international call prefix depends on the country of origin of the call, e.g. 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code. The prefix for international calls from Croatia is 00 (e.g. for a United States number 00 1 xxx should be dialed).
An example for calling a line in Bjelovar-Bilogora County (area code 043) is as follows:

        xxx xxxx    (within the 043 area)
   0 43 xxx xxxx    (within Croatia)
+385 43 xxx xxxx    (outside Croatia)

List of area codes[edit]
Telephone area codes closely correspond to postal codes in Croatia and are assigned to counties. Both the Zagreb County and the City of Zagreb have the same area code (1), which is further divided into 9 areal subgroups (i.e. from 11 to 19, or 011 to 019 for calls from outside the region).

Since the adoption of mobile number portability, prefixes of existing numbers no longer guarantee that number is in the corresponding mobile network, i.e. carried by the mobile carrier that originally issued the number. Any newly issued number follows the above numbering plan.

The country code 599 was assigned to the Netherlands Antilles (dissolved in 2010),[1] and is in use by Curaçao and the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba).[2]
Aruba and Sint Maarten, also former parts of the Netherlands Antilles, discontinued using the code in 1986 and 2011 respectively. Aruba now uses country code 297, and Sint Maarten uses the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) country code 1 with area code 721.[3]
The International call prefix is 00.


Area codes[edit]
Originally each island had an area code with the length of the local numbering varying from island to island (Curaçao had six while Bonaire had only four). Beginning in 1999, the numbers were modified so that each local number was seven digits long. This change left the islands without any area codes, except for Curaçao, which has the area code of 9 along with the seven digit local number.

Sint Maarten joined NANP[edit]
See also: Area code 721
On 2 October 2009, the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) announced that it had approved the request of Sint Maarten's government to join the NANP and had assigned the territory area code 721. Effective 30 September 2011, Sint Maarten's country code changed to the NANP standard of 1. A permissive dialing period of one full year (to 30 September 2012) was in place when dialing 1721 or country code 599 could be used.[4]

Telephone guide to Cyprus closed telephoning numbering plan.
Telephone numbers in CyprusRepublic of Cyprus shown in dark greenLocationCountryCyprusContinentEuropeRegulatorOffice of the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal RegulationTypeClosedNSN  length8Format2x-xxxxxx[note 1]  9x-xxxxxx [note 2]Numbering planCyprus National Numbering PlanLast updated6 May 2011Access codesCountry code+357International access00Long-distancenone
Telephone numbers in Cyprus follow a closed telephone numbering plan which was adopted on 1 December 2001.[1] As a result, for landline phone numbers the digit 2 followed by the old area code was affixed to the subscriber number and for mobile phones 9 was affixed to the phone number. The plan is also used in Akrotiri and Dhekelia.[2]


Currently[edit]
Under the new system, these changed to numbers with eight digits, to be dialled from within Cyprus or abroad.

Landline number in Nicosia called from within Cyprus (including Nicosia):
22 xxxxxx
Landline number in Nicosia called from abroad:
+357 22 xxxxxx
Mobile phone number called from within Cyprus:
9x xxxxxx (during that period only 09 code was in use, from CYTA)
Mobile phone number called from abroad:
+357 9x xxxxxx
As with fixed line numbers, under the new system, these changed to numbers with eight digits, to be dialled from within Cyprus or abroad. Numbering portability between the networks is possible.

Mobile phone number called from within  Cyprus:
9x xxxxxx (the first x depends on the company, as seen below)

All numbers (except short codes) in Cyprus now have eight digits, hence the new numbering plan's promotional logo (in advertising) was an octopus called TESA (from Greek Τελικό Εθνικό Σχέδιο Αριθμοδότησης Final National Numbering Plan).[3]

In the Past[edit]
Previously, landline numbers consisted of the trunk code 0, the area code, and a six-digit number.

Landline number in Nicosia called from Nicosia:
xxxxxx
Landline number in Nicosia called from inside Cyprus (other than Nicosia):
02 xxxxxx
Landline number in Nicosia called from abroad:
+357 2 xxxxxx
Mobile phone numbers had the prefix 09, followed by six digits, which had to be dialled in full.

Mobile phone number called from within Cyprus:
99 xxxxxx (during that period only 09 code was in use, from CYTA)
Mobile phone number called from abroad:
+357 9 xxxxxx
As with fixed line numbers, under the new system, these changed to numbers with eight digits, to be dialled from within Cyprus or abroad. Numbering portability between the networks is possible.

Mobile phone number called from within  Cyprus:
9xxxxxxx (where the first x is either 9 or 7 which belongs to CYTA, 6 which belongs to Epic, 5 to PrimeTel 4 to Cablenet)
Mobile phone number called from abroad after  12/2001:
+357 9x xxxxxx
Regional codes[edit]
The 5 districts of Cyprus under government control each have their own 2 digit dialling code for landline numbers. These are:[4]



District

Dial Code


22

Nicosia


23

Famagusta


24

Larnaca


25

Limassol


26

Pafos

(Note: Kyrenia District is fully within the area not under government control. Although some websites [5][6] claim the code 27 to be for Kyrenia, no phone number is assigned to it.)
After the district code, a 3 digit "area code" is written, which different for every town
(Most towns have multiple codes, depending on how many numbers are in it).
For example the prefixes 723 and 724 are used for Xylotymbou
There isn't a list that displays all the codes, and from researching the yellow pages, the codes don't seem to be able to be narrowed down further and are mostly random.

The situation in Occupied Cyprus[edit]
Main article: Telephone numbers in Northern Cyprus
In Northern Cyprus, the Turkish numbering plan is used. The Turkish area code 0392 has been assigned for use with landline numbers, with 0533 Kuzey Kibris Turkcell and 0542 KKTC Telsim being used for mobile phones, while the Turkish country code +90 is used for calls from the rest of the world.
For calls from the Republic of Cyprus to Northern Cyprus, the code 0139 followed by the 7-digit subscriber number is used, which are charged at local call rates. 0139 is still used for direct calls to Northern Cyprus even after the numbering plan change of December 2001.
For calls from Northern Cyprus to the Republic of Cyprus, area code 0123 is used but the call is charged at international rates. It is also possible to use the international prefix 00357.
These direct telephone connections between the two halves of the island are operated by the United Nations exchange, which allows direct telephone calls between the two communities is in place since 4 May 1998.
After 2 March 2003, direct international calls from the Republic of Cyprus to Turkey are possible. Now callers from the Republic of Cyprus can call Northern Cyprus either through Turkey dialing 0090 392 xxxxxxx (calls charged at international rates), or using 0139 (calls charged at local rates).

Denmark generally uses an eight-digit closed telephone numbering plan. Subscriber numbers are portable with respect to provider and geography, i.e. fixed line numbers can be ported to any physical address in Denmark.
The Kingdom of Denmark also includes two autonomous regions, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, although each has been assigned its own country calling code and has a separate numbering plan. Previously, the Faroe Islands also used the country code +45.[1]

Split charge is not generally used in Denmark anymore; calls to 70 numbers are usually charged as regular landline calls. A few exceptions do exist, e.g., 70 10 11 55 (the TDC speaking clock service).
In the latest published numbering plan,[3] from 2016, there are exceptions to the landline series above. Almost all landline series have one or more exception based on their 3rd digit. Eg. 43-xx-xx-xx is designated as landline numbers, however 43-1x-xx-xx has been reassigned as a cellphone range.

The Faroe Islands later adopted their own country code +298, with international dialling from Denmark being required.[5]
8-digit numbering took place in the years 1986/87, so that the area code had to be used every time, also for local calls.[6]
On 2. September 1986 in the 01, 02, 03 areas (Zealand, Lolland-Falster, Bornholm and Møn).
On 15.  May  1987 in the 09 area (Funen and surrounding islands).
On 16 May 1989, digit 0 was omitted as the first digit, and all telephone numbers should start with a number from 3 to 9.[7]

Today (since 1989) the same telephone number is dialed in Denmark, regardless of where you call from, but the dialling information is still in principle at the forefront of the number. Numbers beginning with 20-31 are preferably mobile numbers, those beginning with 70 and 72-79 are preferably landline numbers, and so on.

Telephone numbers in East TimorLocationCountryEast TimorContinentAsiaTypeclosedAccess codesCountry code+670International access00Long-distancenone
Until September 1999, East Timor formed part of the Indonesian numbering plan, using the country code +62, followed by area codes for the two largest cities, Dili (390)[1] and Baucau (399).[2] Following the violence in the wake of Indonesia's departure from the territory, most of the telecommunications infrastructure was destroyed, and Telkom Indonesia withdrew its services from East Timor.
In the interim, the code +672, used by the Australian External Territories, was used to reach numbers in the territory.[3] Originally, the +672 code had been allocated to the then Portuguese Timor, before its invasion and occupation in 1975.[4]
A new country code, +670, was allocated to East Timor, but international access often remained severely limited. A complicating factor is that 670 was previously used by the Northern Marianas, with many carriers not aware that the code is now used by East Timor, and that the Northern Marianas, now part of the North American Numbering Plan, use the code 1 and the area code 670 instead, although calls to the Northern Marianas from the US are billed as calls to East Timor.[5]
East Timor now has a closed numbering plan; all fixed line subscribers' numbers are seven digits, while mobile phone subscribers' numbers are now eight digits, with a '7' being added to the old seven-digit number.[6]
Telephone numbering in East Timor is as follows:

Calls to and from neighbouring countries[edit]
Until the 1990s, Swaziland was integrated into the South African telephone numbering plan; calls from South Africa to Swaziland were made using the code 0194.[5] Calls to South Africa from Swaziland, however, required the use of the regional code 07.[6] Calls to Lesotho were similarly made using the regional code 05 while those to Mozambique were made using the code 06.[7]

Mobile numbers[edit]
Finnish mobile numbers start with 04x, 0457 or 050. The format for mobile telephone numbers is 04x 123 45 67 or 0457 123 45 67 or 050 123 45 67. When called from a different country, the format is + 358 4x 123 45 67 or + 358 50 123 45 67. Most commonly 7 digits are used for the subscriber number.
The first three digits previously indicated the mobile operator but mobile number portability has been implemented and any prefix can now be associated with any operator, 040 (was owned by TeliaSonera) and 050 (was owned by Elisa, formerly Radiolinja) are the most common prefixes. 042 and 045 0 were also owned by TeliaSonera, whereas 046 was owned by Elisa. Other major networks are DNA Finland (using then 041, 044 and other numbers in the 045 range) and Saunalahti (using numbers in the 045 range). Former operator codes include 043, which was used in DCS "city phones". Some of these may still be in use. The former NMT network numbers used operator code 049. Most NMT numbers were transferred to GSM numbers with format 04x0 123 456 or 0500 123 456, as there were only 6 subscriber numbers in NMT numbers.
The area code for fixed landline subscriptions in Kymi is 05, and should not be confused with mobile numbers starting with 050.

Short numbers[edit]
Upon launching the world's first GSM network in 1991,[5] operator Radiolinja (later merged with Elisa) issued short phone numbers in the format 050 XXXX and 050 XXXXX to their employees and shareholders until the early 2000s. New shareholders purchasing 5000 FIM (about 1101 EUR in 2021[6]) or more worth of shares could request a number. Only 280 four-digit numbers and 6,800 five-digit numbers were issued. Such numbers continue to be in use and can be transferred between operators just like longer numbers.[7][8][9]

International access[edit]
The default international access code is 00, although when dialing the Telex number, the prefix 99 is required.[10]
When dialing from a mobile phone, + (a plus sign) can be used as a substitute for keying in the international access code.

Telephone numbers in France5 geographic zonesLocationCountryFranceContinentEuropeRegulatorARCEPTypeClosedNSN  length9Format0x xx xx xx xxAccess codesCountry code33International access00Long-distance0
The French telephone numbering plan is used in Metropolitan France, French overseas departments and some overseas collectivities.
Since 1996, France uses a ten-digit closed numbering plan, where the first two digits denote a geographic area, mobile or non-geographic number.

01 Île-de-France
02 Northwest France
03 Northeast France
04 Southeast France
05 Southwest France
06 Mobile phone services
07 Mobile phone services
08 Special phone numbers: Freephone (numéro vert) and shared-cost services.
09 Non-geographic number (used by Voice over IP services)
All geographic numbers are dialed in the ten-digit format, even for local calls. The international access code is the International Telecommunication Union's recommended 00.[1]
When calling France from abroad, the leading zero should be omitted: for example, to call a number in Southwest France, one would dial +33 5 xx xx xx xx.
French people usually state phone numbers as a sequence of five double-digit numbers, e.g., 0x xx xx xx xx (and not, for example, 0 xxx-xxx-xxx or 0xxx-xx-xxxx or 0xx-xxx-xxxx).[2]


History[edit]
For many years, French subscribers' telephone numbers consisted of eight digits (including the one-digit area code 1 for all of Paris and its surrounding departments, or a two-digit area code from 20 to 99 for other metropolitan departments; this area code was dialed only after the trunk code 16). The territories of Overseas France all had their own local numbering plans and used their own country codes but no area codes, and calls between different territories or Metropolitan France required a dialing international call using the international call prefix 19 followed by the country code, area code, and subscriber number.
But that system began to run out of numbers in the 1980s, leading to the adoption of a new "eight-digit" numbering plan on 25 October 1985.[3] On that date, France changed to a system of two zones, one for Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France and another for the other departments.[4] Outside Paris, the old area code was incorporated into the subscriber's eight-digit number; for Paris, the area code 1 was retained, and a 4 was prefixed to seven-digit numbers, meaning that a subscriber's number could begin with 40, for example 4056 1873. For numbers in the Île-de-France surrounding Paris, the old codes 3x and 6x joined the old seven-digit numbers to become eight-digit numbers and were assigned to the Paris area code 1, with the trunk prefix 16 required for calls from the rest of France, followed by the area code 1 for Paris and the eight-digit number.[5] To call the rest of France from Paris, however, the trunk prefix 16 had to be dialed before the eight-digit number.
On 18 October 1996, this changed to the present "ten-digit" system (including the default one-digit leading trunk code 0), in which each call is dialed using all ten digits, this national scheme being also extended to cover Overseas France in a single area.[6] Area codes were abolished, and since then France has had a closed numbering plan, where all local or national calls require dialing the leading trunk code.
Following liberalisation in 1998, subscribers (first deployed on land lines and rapidly extended to all mobile networks) could access different carriers by replacing the leading trunk code 0 (omitted from numbers when called from outside France) with another carrier selection code (one digit from 2 to 9, or four digits 16xx). For example, Cegetel required subscribers to dial 7; e.g., Paris 71 xx xx xx xx, instead of 01 xx xx xx xx. Similarly, the international access code using Cegetel would be 70 instead of 00 by replacing the first 0.[7] Since then, the carrier selection code still exists, but carrier preselection (and number portability) is offered by default on all subscriber lines, and the one-digit carrier selection is rarely used. As well, several important national operators merged, and the four-digit carrier selection only persists for subscribers of various international service providers (most of them for mobile telephony, but these carrier selection prefixes are often dialed internally by a terminal device and callers don't need to care about it, unless they want to select carriers for different services). Additionally, call fees no longer depend on distance throughout the French numbering plan, so carrier selection remains used only for international calls.
The 09 prefix was introduced for non-geographic numbers and special services in September 2006[8] and older numbers such as 08 7x xx xx xx (used for VoIP in Internet boxes) were replaced by 09 5x xx xx xx (telephone service offered by Internet service provider Free, later followed by other French ISPs).[citation needed]
The national information service 12 was closed in 2005 which lead to the creation of many new information services 118 xxx. They cost €3 per call plus €3 per minute.

Defunct prefixes[edit]
Changed in 1996:

16 - Long distance prefix - Changed to: 0
19 - International prefix - Changed to: 00
The second dial tone was also removed. Dialling procedures now reflect ETSI and ITU recommendations.

Overseas departments and territories[edit]
The French overseas departments (départements d'outre mer or DOM) have separate country codes from metropolitan France, with Réunion being assigned the code 262[9] while Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Martinique were assigned the codes 590, 594 and 596 respectively.[10] Until 1996, the use of the international access code 19 and country code was required for calls from metropolitan France.[1] For example, to call Guadeloupe from metropolitan France, a subscriber would dial 19 590 xxx xxx, 590 being the country code.[11] This included the islands of Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin, which later separated from Guadeloupe to become collectivities, although they still use the same country code. By contrast, calls to metropolitan France from the overseas departments only required the use of the trunk code 16.[1]
However, under the new present French numbering plan, direct dialling was introduced for calls between the DOMs (including collectivités territoriales) and metropolitan France, requiring only the '0' to be dialed, with the country code being used as a geographical area code.[6] Despite this, the 33 country code was not adopted for calls to the DOMs from the rest of the world, because of technical difficulties with operators in neighbouring countries, for example, calls to Réunion from Mauritius would have to be routed via metropolitan France, adversely affecting voice quality as well as increasing call costs.[12]
In 2001, telephone numbers in the DOMs changed to the same ten-digit format as metropolitan France, with new prefixes beginning with the digit '6' being adopted for mobile phone services:

Mobile phone line: +596 696 xx xx xx or +596 697 xx xx xx
Réunion[edit]
From France:

Mobile phone line: +262 692 xx xx xx or +262 693 xx xx xx
Others[edit]
Before 30 March 2007 the collectivité départementale of Mayotte used country code +269, shared with the Comoros: 

From France, including Mayotte: 0 269 xx xx xx
From Comoros: xx xx xx
Outside France and Comoros: +269 xx xx xx
On 30 March 2007 Mayotte adopted the +262 code, used by Réunion, and a new numbering range was introduced for mobile phones:

From France:
Fixed phone line:  0 269 xx xx xx
Mobile phone line: 0 639 xx xx xx
Outside France:
Fixed phone line:  +262 269 xx xx xx
Mobile phone line: +262 639 xx xx xx
Calls to Saint Pierre and Miquelon require only '0', country code and the subscriber's six-digit number, e.g.: 

From France: 0 508 xx xx xx
Outside France: +508 xx xx xx
Calls to and from the territoires d'outre mer, however, require full international dialing, hence the international access code and country code must be used:

Paris from New Caledonia: 00 33 1 xx xx xx xx
New Caledonia from Paris: 00 687 xx xx xx
Andorra and Monaco[edit]
Until 17 December 1994, Andorra formed part of the French numbering plan, with calls from France requiring the prefix 628,[13] (or 16 628 from Paris).[14] Those from the rest of the world were made using +33 628,[15] except from Spain, which were made using the prefix 9738.[14] On that date, the principality adopted the country code +376.[16] Consequently, all calls from France to Andorra had to be dialled in international format, using the prefix 19 376.[17] This was later changed to 00 376, along with the second French reform of 1996 to the newer "ten-digit" plan.[18]
On 21 June 1996, Monaco similarly adopted its own country code +377, replacing access from France (+33 93).[19]

Telephone numbers in GeorgiaLocation of Georgia (dark green) Abkhazia and South Ossetia (light green)LocationCountryGeorgiaContinentEuropeTypeclosedAccess codesCountry code+995International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Georgia consist of 9 digits and follow a closed numbering plan in which the initial 2 or 3 digits indicate the service or area code (in case of geographic numbers) and the remaining 6 or 7 digits identify the subscriber.


Numbering plan[edit]
The current dialling plan is in force since 4 June 2011 when a wide-ranging reform took place. Specifically, area codes were updated to start with 2 or 3, mobile numbers came to begin with the digit 5, and some geographical numbers were padded with an additional digit 2 or 3 immediately after the area code to the total number of digits equalling 9. The current plan is as follows: 



Prefix/Code

Description


1XX

Used for emergency/special numbers and international calls prefix. E.g., 111 - Fire Service


2XX

Reserved


3X(X)

Area codes of in eastern Georgia. E.g., 32 - Tbilisi, 341 - Rustavi


4X(X)

Area codes in western Georgia. E.g., 431 - Kutaisi


5XX

Prefixes of mobile operators. E.g., 595 - MagtiCom


6XX

Reserved


7XX

Non-geographical services. E.g., 790 - Magtifix, fixed mobile operator


8XX

Toll free and shared-cost numbers. E.g., 800


9XX

Premium-cost numbers

Geographic numbering[edit]
Since 1 March 2011, area codes have changed and the first digit came to indicate the respective part of the country: numbers start with  3  for eastern Georgia and with  4  for western Georgia. The current area codes are as follows:

Mobile telephony numbering[edit]
Georgian mobile operators receive their number allocations in blocks of 1 million numbers, hence the first three digits usually indicate the original mobile network providing the number. However, since mobile number portability was introduced in Georgia on 15 February 2011, the links are no longer certain. 
Telephone prefixes originally distributed to mobile operators are listed below.
On 20 June 2011, the digit 5 was added to the prefixes for mobile operators.[1] For example, prefix 77 was changed to 577.

In addition, the mobile operator Aquafon operating in Abkhazia and using the Russian (+7) 9409 code can also be reached using the Georgian code (+995) 544.


Fixed wireless numbering[edit]
On 27 June 2011, prefixes for fixed wireless telephony changed:[2] digit 7 have been added to the prefix. For example, prefix 90 have been changed to 790.

Dialling[edit]
Calling within Georgia[edit]
Calling geographical numbers:

 0 - Destination area code [2 or 3 digits] - Subscriber's phone number [6 or 7 digits]

Calling mobile numbers:

 0 - Subscriber's number [9 digits]

For example, to dial landline phone in Tbilisi:

 xxx xxxx              (within Tbilisi) 
 0 - 32 - xxx xxxx     (within Georgia) 
 +995 - 32 - xxx xxxx  (from abroad)

To dial mobile number, for example the one of Magticom:

 595 - xxx xxx         (from mobile network) 
 0 - 595 - xxx xxx     (within Georgia, from landlines) 
 +995 - 595 - xxx xxx  (from abroad)

Calling abroad[edit]
The dial plan is as follows:

 Optional carrier code – 00 - Destination country code - Subscriber number

The following carrier codes are in use for international communication:

Telephone numbers in Germany8 geographic zonesLocationCountryGermanyContinentEuropeRegulatorFederal Network AgencyTypeOpenNSN  length3 to 13[1]Format(xx…) xx…Access codesCountry code49International access00Long-distance0List of Germany dialing codes
The regulation of telephone numbers in Germany is the responsibility of the Federal Network Agency (German: Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA) of the German government. The agency has a mandate to telecommunications in Germany and other infrastructure systems.


Overview[edit]
Germany has an open telephone numbering plan. Before 2010, area codes and subscriber telephone numbers had no fixed size, meaning that some subscriber numbers may be as short as two digits. As a result, dialing sequences are generally of a variable length, except for some non-geographic area codes for which subscriber numbers use a fixed-length format. It is not possible to determine unambiguously the end of a phone number from a prefix or the digits already dialed. This feature allows the extension of the length of phone numbers without revoking or changing existing numbers. Mobile telephones are assigned to non-geographic codes, making them readily recognizable.
A new numbering plan was introduced on 3 May 2010. Since then newly assigned landline telephone numbers have a standard length of eleven digits, including the area code. Area codes remained unchanged, variable in length. Exceptions to the eleven-digit rule are the four cities of Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich, which are the only cities with two-digit area codes and have ten-digit numbers to avoid exceeding the maximum length of eight digits for a subscriber number.[2]
The German telephone network uses 5,200 geographical area codes, the length of which varies from two to five digits (not including the trunk code 0), with five-digit area codes being assigned only in the New States (prefix 3). In general, geographic area codes start with digits 2 to 9, whereas other non-geographic area codes (including those for cell phones) are assigned to 1 and network services to 11.[3]

Geographic numbering[edit]
Main article: Area codes in Germany
Geographic area codes have a length of two to five digits. The maximum length of a complete telephone number is eleven digits.
Numbers for geographic area codes are assigned to carriers in blocks. Subscriber numbers do not start with 0 or 11 and can be dialled without area code from landlines within the same geographic area code.
Originally, the first digits following the area code indicated a smaller service area or the type of the subscriber line (analogue or ISDN). This is no longer true as subscribers can keep their numbers when moving within an area code or when switching from analogue to ISDN. Furthermore, new carriers assign numbers from different blocks.

(xx) xxxx-xxxx
This is the format used for the four largest geographic areas in Germany: Berlin (30), Hamburg (40), Frankfurt (69) and Munich (89).
Newly assigned numbers have a length of eight digits for the local subscriber number, yielding a total length of ten digits (not including the 0 trunk code). This is shorter than the maximum of eleven digits in other areas to avoid exceeding eight digits.
Numbers assigned in the past, which are generally grandfathered, may be as short as five digits.
(xxx) xxxx-xxxx
In area codes of three digits, newly assigned numbers (for all locations from May 2010; earlier in some cities, e.g. Cologne in February 2007) also have eight digits, yielding a total of eleven digits. Grandfathered numbers may be as short as four digits (seven total).
(xxxx) xxx-xxxx
In area codes with four digits, newly assigned numbers (for all locations from May 2010, earlier in some cities, e.g. Heidelberg in May 2003) have seven digits, also yielding a total of eleven digits. Grandfathered numbers may be as short as three digits (seven total) in very rural areas.
(3xxxx) xx-xxxx
Some smaller areas in the former East Germany have five-digit area codes, all of which start with 3. Newly assigned numbers (for all locations from May 2010, earlier in some locations) have six digits, also yielding a total number length of eleven digits.
Non-geographic numbering[edit]
Main article: Area codes in Germany
Non-geographic numbers were originally assigned the prefix 1. However, some of these services have been moved to other area codes.

10xy, 100yy
These numbers can be dialled before the telephone number to select a carrier.
11…
Area codes starting with 11 overlap the prefix for network services. In general, these numbers cannot be dialled from abroad, with the exception being 116xxx for harmonised services of social value.
12xx-xxxxxxx…
The prefix 012 has been assigned as a testbed for innovative services, such as VoIP or unified messaging, for which no other area codes were available. Allocations were only valid for a maximum of five years, after which new numbers would have to be assigned. Recent requests for registrations have been declined and referred to the premium-rate services under 900. When the last remaining allocation expires in 2011[update],[needs update] the prefix is planned to be returned to the reserved range.
137-xxx xxxxxxx, (138-1xxx…)
The area code 137 is assigned for services that may result in a high number of connections in a fairly short period of time, e.g. votes or competitions initiated from TV or radio shows. The first digit indicates the rate for a call, the second digit indicates the maximum number of calls that can be handled per time period.
There are also sixteen[3] grandfathered numbers in the range 138-1, which were originally allocated by Deutsche Bundespost.
15xx-xxxxxxx, 16x-xxxxxxx, 17x-xxxxxxx
Mobile numbers are assigned non-geographic area codes starting with 15, 16 and 17 and have a length of three or four digits without the trunk prefix. The numbers have a total length of ten or eleven digits without the trunk prefix: numbers starting with 17 or 16 are ten digits long, except 176 and 1609, which have eleven digits like the numbers starting with 15.
Network operators issue area codes as listed in the following table.

However, since the advent of mobile number portability, mobile phone number prefixes can no longer be relied on to determine the current operator behind a particular mobile phone number – only the original operator. As mobile phone plans often include different rates for intra-network calls, it is important for users on such plans to know the network operator of the party they wish to call. The information on which number is registered to which cellular network is updated daily and is publicly available.
All network operators offer free automated services that can be reached via phone and/or internet and give users the ability to enter any number and determine to which network the number belongs.
18xx-xxxxxxx…18xxxxxxx-xx
The prefix 018 is used for user groups. The length of the block number and the terminal number is flexible from two to seven digits. However, the sum is always nine digits, yielding a total length of eleven digits including the 18.
180-xxxxxxx
The area code 180 is used for service-oriented services, such as call centres, hotlines, etc. Prior to 1 March 2010, these numbers were known as shared-cost services, a name that had been obsoleted by falling prices for national calls.

The area code 181 is used for international virtual private networks (international user groups). The length of the IVPN block number is three or four digits; the terminal number may be up to seven digits.
19xxx
Numbers from 191 to 194 are used for dial-up access to online services (e.g. to the Internet).
198…, 199…
Numbers starting with 198 and 199 are reserved for routing of service numbers and network-internal use.
31-x
The numbers 31-0 and 31-1 are test numbers that reach a recorded announcement indicating the selected carrier for long-distance and local calls, respectively.
32-xxxxxxxxx
National subscriber numbers have been allocated the area code 32. They are similar to geographic numbers but not tied to a specific location, allowing for nomadic use. Unlike personal numbers, national subscriber numbers are assigned to carriers in blocks, from which these carriers can make derivative assignments to subscribers. The total length is eleven digits (not counting the 0).
700-xxxxxxxx
The area code 700 is used for personal numbering. Unlike national subscriber numbers, the numbers are assigned individually, allowing for memorable numbers.
800-xxxxxxx
The area code 800 is assigned to freephone numbers. The numbers are assigned individually, allowing for memorable numbers.
900-x-xxxxxx
The area code 900 is assigned to premium-rate services. The first digit following the area code indicates the service type:


Prefix

Service Type


900-1

Information services (no adult content)


900-3

Entertainment services (no adult content)


900-5

Other services (including those offering adult content)

The numbers are assigned individually, allowing for memorable numbers.
9009-xxxxxxx
So-called "dialers" – that is, programmes that call a premium-rate service or modify a computer's configuration to call such a service – must use numbers in the area code 9009. These programmes must also be registered with the Federal Network Agency.
Emergency and network services[edit]
Network services are not dialed with the trunk prefix 0. They resemble local numbers that start with 11 but usually cannot be dialed after an area code.

110 – Police
112 – Fire brigade, ambulance, rescue services (also the universal emergency number in the EU)
115 – Civil services (Bürgertelefon); requests are either answered directly or forwarded to the competent authority in the caller's region. The caller can access local government services and book appointments at government offices.[4][5]
116 xxx – Harmonised services of social value
118 xx – Directory assistance
19 222 – Non-emergency medical transports. This number is not an emergency number but a local number assigned uniformly in all geographic area codes. This requires dialling the area code from mobile phones or other non-geographic lines.
(Originally, the block 19 xxx was used for local numbers assigned uniformly in all or several geographic area codes. All other allocations have already been converted to ordinary geographic numbers.)
History[edit]
Before German reunification, East Germany used country code +37. West Berlin was integrated into the West German telephone network, using the same international dialling code (+49) of West Germany, with the area code 311,[6] later changed to 030.[7] Unlike West Germany, from which calls to East Berlin were made using the prefix 00372 (international access code 00, East German country code 37, area code 2),[8] calls from West Berlin required only the short code 0372.[9] Conversely, those made to West Berlin from East Berlin only required the short code 849.[10]
In 1992, two years after reunification, the telephone networks were merged under country code +49.
Geographic numbers in the New States were assigned area codes starting with 3, in some cases followed by the former East German area code (without the initial 0) or a code similar to it. Thus, Leipzig, for example, which had used East German domestic area code 41, was assigned the new area code 341 in the unified telephone system. On the other hand, some area codes were changed: for example, the small town of Zossen used to have East German area code 323, but the new area code is 3377. Area code 30, formerly used by West Berlin, was assigned to the entire reunified Berlin.
The released country code +37 was later reused as the initial digits of several new codes for European countries that became independent states at the time (e.g.: +370 for Lithuania, +374 for Armenia, +375 for Belarus, etc.), as well as some microstates whose telephone networks had formerly been integrated to those of surrounding larger countries (e.g. +376 for Andorra, +377 for Monaco and +378 for San Marino).
The German telephone network became fully digital in 1997, allowing more flexible use of the numbering space.
On 1 January 1998, the Federal Network Agency (named the Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Postal Services at the time) became the numbering authority for telephone numbers in Germany.

Mobile numbering plan[edit]
Due to the unreliability of fixed-line infrastructure in Ghana, mobile phones are more widely used.  Competition among the various mobile carriers has spurred growth with a subscriber penetration rate of 98% in 2010.[2]  The poor call quality of mobile phones, however, means that more people hold more than one mobile phone, usually with two or more different carriers.
The various mobile carriers in Ghana have each been assigned a network code.

The Gibraltar telephone numbering plan is the system used for assigning telephone numbers in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. It is regulated by the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA), which holds responsibility for telecommunications.
The country calling code to Gibraltar is +350, which was assigned to the territory by the International Telecommunication Union in the late 1960s.[1] When calling abroad from Gibraltar, the international call prefix is 00.[2]


History[edit]
Site of the first telephone exchange in City Mill Lane.
Gibraltar's first telephone exchange was set up in 1886 as a private enterprise and then taken over by the Government of Gibraltar. In the 1970s there were three generations of automatic telephone exchange equipment in use with four and five-digit numbers, the latter prefixed with the digit '7'.[3]
The volume of calls grew and a System X digital exchange was installed and was taken over by a privatised telephone operator, Gibtel, which also operate a GSM network.
Direct telephone connections between Gibraltar and Spain were severed in 1969, when land communications between both territories were halted by the government of Francisco Franco, as a result of the Spanish sovereignty claim, and were not restored until 1986.[4]
However, Gibraltar remained subject to restrictions after that date, which affected the expansion and modernisation of Gibraltar's telecommunications infrastructure. These included a refusal to recognise Gibraltar's International Direct Dialling (IDD) code (+350) which restricted the expansion of  Gibraltar's telephone numbering plan, and the prevention of roaming arrangements for Gibraltar GSM mobile phones in Spain and vice versa.[5] Following the signing of the Córdoba Accord between the Governments of Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Spain in September 2006, these restrictions were removed with effect from 10 February 2007.

New numbering plan[edit]
Since 1 October 2008 telephone numbers for landlines and mobile phones in Gibraltar have been eight digits long. Prior to this date, landline numbers consisted of five digits starting with either 4, 5 or 7, while mobile phone numbers remained unchanged. Since this date all calls to existing Gibtelecom five-digit landline number have to be prefixed with 200, making the numbers eight digits long.[6]
Thus 52200 became 20052200 and when dialled from outside Gibraltar +350 20052200.
CTS (Gibraltar) Limited, an alternative telecommunications provider began to offer a landline service prefixed with 216 and a mobile service with numbers prefixed by 606. This company ceased to operate in 2013.[7]
Since September 2015, U-mee, a provider of fibre broadband services, has offered a fixed line telephone service called U-mee Talk, in which numbers will be prefixed with the digits 222.[8]
Since late 2017, Gibfibrespeed, a provider of  fibre broadband services, has offered a fixed line telephone service, in which numbers are prefixed with the digits 225,[9] The GRA itself has announced regular updates to the numbering plan, and Gibfibrespeed as a fixed line operator is also licensed to provide carrier routing and transit services.[10]

Map of geographical area codes in Greece
This is a list of dialing codes in Greece. The first digit represents the type of service. 1 is used for short codes, 2 for geographical numbers (3 and 4 are reserved for that purpose too), 5 is used for inter-network routing purposes (non-dialable codes) and VPNs, 6 for mobile services, 7 is reserved for universal access numbers (not active), 8 for reduced-fee services (like 800 toll-free, 801 local call, 89 dial-up and data services), 9 is used for premium rate services (901 for general purpose and 909 for adult-only services). All dialable numbers are ten digits, except for short codes (3–5 digits in the 1 range), 807-XXXX (seven digits) used for calling card access codes, and numbers in the 5 range, used for routing purposes and not dialable by end-subscribers.


Overview[edit]
Geographical area codes start with the digit 2. There are currently two-, three-, and four-digit area codes. The only two-digit area code is 21 for the Athens Metropolitan area; three-digit codes are used for the cities Thessaloniki, Patras, Larissa, Heraklion, Kavala, and Tripoli. The rest of the codes are four-digit codes.
Generally speaking, the second digit of a geographical area code signifies a broader geographical area of Greece. That is how area codes are sorted in this article.
Two-digit codes are used with eight-digit subscriber numbers, three-digit codes with seven-digit numbers, and four-digit codes with six-digit numbers, so the full telephone number is always ten digits.
Subscriber numbers in most areas start with 0. That is the digit that was inserted between the area code and the subscriber number to form the new ten-digit numbering plan back in 2002. Thus, many Greeks erroneously think that the area codes include this leading 0. For example, they think that Athens's area code is 210 while, actually, Athens's area code is 21, with 0 being the first digit of the subscriber number.
Subscriber numbers starting with 0 are assigned to the former monopoly OTE. In bigger cities like Athens and Thessaloniki, subscriber numbers starting with digits other than 0 are becoming more and more common, especially amongst business subscribers. In this case, many people think that the area code is different. For example, a subscriber number in Athens might start with 211, with people thinking that 211 is a distinct area code from 210 while, in reality, both numbers are in the 21 area code and the third digit of the number belongs to the subscriber number.
The international call prefix depends on the country from which you are calling, for example, 00 for most European countries and 011 from North America.
In 2001-2002, Greece moved to a closed ten-digit numbering scheme in two stages, with the result that subscribers' numbers changed twice. For example, before the change, a number in Athens would have been dialed as follows:



  xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called within Athens)


(01) xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called from within Greece)


+30 1  xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called from outside Greece)

In 2001, a '0' was added after the area code, which was incorporated into the subscriber's number:



01 0xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called from within Greece)


+30 1 0xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called from outside Greece)

Finally, in 2002, the leading '0' was changed to a '2' (for geographic numbers) :



21 x xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called from within Greece)


+30 21 x xxx xxxx
(Athens numbers called from outside Greece)

For mobile phone numbers, the leading '0' was changed to a '6'.
Note that because of number portability, for both geographical and non-geographical (mobile, toll-free, premium rate) numbers, one cannot be sure about the operator that a number belongs to. All geographical codes (21x, 231x) end in a number from 0 to 6 (210 or 212 for Athens, 2310 or 2312 for Thessaloniki). Numbers whose code ends in "0" are or were originally operated by OTE. The same applies to mobile phones: All mobile codes (69x) end in 0,3,4,5,7,8 or 9 (690, 698). Mobile code "696" is assigned to OTE pagers. Numbers starting with 690 and 693 were originally assigned to WIND, with 694 and 695 to Vodafone, with 697 and 698 to Cosmote and with 699 to Q-Telecom until 2007 when it merged with WIND.

Telephone numbers in Hong KongLocation of Hong KongLocationCountryHong KongContinentAsiaRegulatorCommunications AuthorityTypeClosedFormat+852 XXXX XXXX (Mobile phone and fixed-line numbers)Access codesCountry code+852International access001Long-distancenone
Telephone numbers in Hong Kong are mostly eight-digit. Fixed land line numbers start with 2 or 3, mobile (cellular) phone numbers with 5, 6, 7 or 9, pager numbers with 7 and forwarding service with 8[citation needed]. Since the end of 1989, there have been no area codes within Hong Kong.
The telephone number for emergency services – Police, Fire Service and Ambulance – is 999 for all telephone lines. These numbers can also be used for mobile and other users:

992 – fax on fixed line, SMS on mobile phones (for subscribers with disabilities)
112 – mobile phones
Some special numbers are three- to five-digit. Some premium rate services, for example for games and adult contents, are 11-digit. Numbers beginning with '1' are usually reserved for carrier/operator services. These services are provided by the individual telephone carrier. In general, these numbers can be used across all carriers:

Directory services – 1081 (English), 1083 (Cantonese) and 1088 (Mandarin)
Time and temperature information – 18501 (English), 18503 (Cantonese) and 18508 (Mandarin)
The international call prefix varies depending on IDD provider, however 001 works on all phone lines and uses the IDD service provided by the same carrier as the telephone line that 001 call is dialed from. During the years of telephone monopoly, the International call prefix was 106 (through 1980s) and then 001. Calls from Hong Kong to Macau and mainland China are international, and include that regions' country code:

Macau +853 xxxx xxxx
Mainland China +86 (area code) xxxx xxxx

Present numbering scheme and format[edit]

Historical numbering scheme and area codes[edit]
1970s[edit]
In the 1970s, area codes were assigned with the following pattern:

3 Kowloon, New Kowloon, Ha Kwai Chung and Sai Kung
5 Hong Kong Island and Outlying Islands
12 New Territories
There was no standard trunk prefix like '0' – only the area code and phone number were dialed when calling from one area code to another. Thus the Kowloon number xxx-xxx would have been dialed as follows:

xxx-xxx – from within Kowloon
3 xxx-xxx – from Hong Kong Island or New Territories
+852 3 xxx-xxx – from the rest of the world
1980s[edit]
In the mid-1980s, 6-digit numbers starting with '0' became 7-digit numbers starting with '71', making way for subsequent change of the New Territories prefix from '12' to '0'.

0xxxxx became 71xxxxx
Fixed-line phone numbers were either six- or seven-digit in the 1980s. Area codes were assigned with the following patterns.

3 Kowloon, New Kowloon, Ha Kwai Chung and Sai Kung
5 Hong Kong Island and Outlying Islands
0 New Territories
Cellular phone numbers are all eight-digit starting with '9'.

Easy Dialling Day[edit]
On 30 December 1989, area codes were abolished.[3] Six-digit numbers in the New Territories were changed to replace the initial 8 with 46, followed by five digits; area codes for six-digit numbers in the other areas became part of subscriber's numbers. Area codes for seven-digit numbers were simply removed. Some six-digit numbers had the first digit changed to two digits to make a seven-digit number.

(3) xxx xxx became 3xx xxxx
(3) 7xx xxxx became 7xx xxxx
(5) xxx xxx became 5xx xxxx
(5) Nxx xxxx became Nxx xxxx (N = 8 or 9)
(0) 8xx xxx became 46x xxxx
(0) Nxx xxxx became Nxx xxxx (N = 4 or 6)
1990s[edit]
On January 1, 1995,[4] a '2' was prefixed to all fixed line (land line) numbers which are now eight-digit. A '7' was prefixed to existing pager service numbers.

xxx xxxx became 2xxx xxxx
11xx xxx became 711xx xxx
11xx xxxxx became 7xx xxxxx
9xxx xxxx remain unchanged
Since 2000s[edit]
Before the introduction of portable fixed line numbers, numbers were assigned in a pattern akin to districts. For example, in addition to the existing 3, 5 and 0 prefixes, a 4 prefix was used for Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, 6 for Tai Po and Sha Tin, and 8 for Hong Kong Island.
Numbers starting with '3' were introduced when '2' for fixed lines started running out. Cell phone numbers remain eight-digit. The number '6' started to be used when numbers started with '9' were running out. In May 2008, cellular phone numbers with '5' as the beginning were also introduced.
Due to numerous phone scams spoofing local telephone numbers, calls started from outside Hong Kong using a local number now show the Hong Kong prefix +852 before the phone numbers in Caller ID.[5]

This article details the dialling protocol for reaching Hungarian telephone numbers from within Hungary. The standard landline number consists of 6 numerals except those in Budapest which have 7 numerals, as do mobile numbers. Before keying the subscriber number required, a caller may need to enter a domestic code (06) and an area code.


Hungary area codes[edit]
In Hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two, except for Budapest (the capital), which has the area code 1.  Landline numbers are six digits in general; numbers in Budapest and mobile numbers are seven digits.

Making calls within and from Hungary[edit]
Calls within local areas can be made by dialling the number without the area code, such as 123 4567 in Budapest or 123 456 in other areas. However, this is not permitted in mobile phone networks.
Domestic calls to all other area codes must be preceded with 06 + area code. For example, a call from Budapest to Monor (area code 29) would be made as 06 29 123 456 and a call from Monor to Budapest (area code 1) would be made as 06 1 234 5678. When using mobile phones, the international format can be used instead: +36 1 234 5678.
Calls to international destinations are in the format 00 + country code + number. On mobile phones, + can be used instead of 00.

Making calls from abroad[edit]
Calls to local areas from abroad can be made using the international prefix + country code + area code. 
The national trunk code 06 used inside Hungary shall not be dialed from abroad. 
For example, a call to Monor (area code 29) would be made as +36 29 123 456 or 00 36 29 123 456, where the +36 or the 0036 prefixes represent the country code of Hungary. 

Short numbers[edit]
Certain services can be called with a short number, ignoring the above scheme.

112 - Emergency number (ambulance, fire brigade, police)
104 - Ambulance
105 - Fire Brigade
107 - Police
143 - Telephone fault reporting
180 - Time service

Telephone numbers in Iceland are seven digits long and generally written in the form xxx xxxx or xxx-xxxx and the E.123 format specifies +354 xxx xxxx from abroad since the country code is +354.
There are no area codes in this closed numbering plan and the international call prefix is 00. Numbers of mobile phones tend to begin with either 6xx xxxx, 7xx xxxx or 8xx xxxx, while landline numbers starting with 5xx xxxx (in Reykjavík) or 4xx xxxx (the countryside). Numbers starting with 3 are nine digits long, 3xx xxx xxx.

Allocation of numbers[edit]
The current format of 7 digit telephone numbers was adopted on 3 June 1995, when 1 to 3 numbers (depending on region) were added to numbers to standardise on number length. At this time, the international direct dialling code became 00 (previously 90), in line with ITU recommendations. Also, the unified number for emergency services was changed to 112 on 1 October 1995. Over the years new number allocations such as new mobile networks (Vodafone Iceland and NOVA), were granted prefixes.[1]

Geographic numbers for landlines were historically fixed to area codes and is still loosely followed currently when a new landline is installed, a sample of which is shown below. However, since the advent of telephone number portability, any landline number can be ported to another area of the country and therefore the old area codes are not a definitive indication of location. In addition, mobile number portability means that number pools assigned originally assigned to one carrier can be ported over by the user.

Telephone numbers in India are administered under the National Numbering Plan of 2003 by the Department of Telecommunications of the Government of India. The numbering plan was last updated in 2015. The country code "91" was assigned to India by the International Telecommunication Union in the 1960s.[1]

The first-ever long-distance subscriber trunk dialing (STD) call in India was made between the cities of Kanpur and Lucknow in 1960.[citation needed]
The total length of all phone numbers (area code and the phone number) is constant at 10 digits. For example, the number 7513200000 signifies the area code 751 (the area code for Gwalior) followed by the phone number.
Fixed-line or landline numbers are at most 8 digits long.

Fixed-line operators
Due to the availability of multiple operators offering fixed-line (landline) services (either wired or wireless), there is an operator code for each telephone number, which is the first digit in the phone number.[2][3]



Operator
Prefix


BSNL / MTNL
2


Jio
3


Airtel
4


MTS / HFCL
5


Tata Indicom
6


Datacom Solutions
7

For example, a number formatted in the style (020) 3xxx-xxxx represents a fixed-line number in Pune operated by Jio, while (011) 2xxx-xxxx is a fixed-line number in Delhi operated by MTNL, and (07582) 2xx-xxx is a fixed-line number in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh operated by BSNL.

Format for dialling fixed-line numbers
No prefix is required to call from one landline to another within the same area code, as variable-length dialling rules apply. A prefix of the number zero + the area code is required to dial from a landline phone in one STD code area to another. The same prefix of the number zero + the area code is required to dial any fixed-line number in India from a mobile phone, irrespective of the area code.
For example, to dial a landline number in Indore, one would have to dial

from a landline in Indore:  the phone number
from a landline in Mumbai: 0731 and then the phone number
from any mobile phone in India: 0731 and then the phone number
from outside India: +91, then 731, and then the phone number
Before 10 March 2009, as per Department of Telecommunications memorandum dated 9 February 2009.[4][5] there were some exceptions to this general rule for STD areas falling close to each other  (within a radius of 200 kilometre), where "0" can be replaced with "95" e.g. to dial Delhi from Gurgaon, one dials 9511+landline number.

Mobile numbers
Main article: Mobile telephone numbering in India
A typical mobile number in India is "+91 xxxx-nnnnnn". The first four digits initially indicated an operator's code, while the remaining six digits are unique to the subscriber. However, with mobile number portability in place, the first four digits no longer indicate a particular operator.

Short code
There are many businesses in the Indian market who rent keywords on a monthly basis, whose characters on a typical mobile phone keypad represent short codes. Short codes are five digits in length and have to start with the digit '5' like 58888 as of 2007. Previously, they were four-digit in number and could be of any combination, like 8888 or 7827. The current five digits can be extended by three digits further representing 3 additional characters. Messages sent to these short codes are commonly referred to as Premium Rate SMS Messages and have a cost per message depending on the operator as well as the service and the company.

Telemarketing
Telemarketers have been issued 10-digit telephone numbers starting with 140 (140XXXXXXX) by the Department of Telecommunications on TRAI's request.[6][7]

Notes
1.^ The Chandigarh Capital Region is a metropolitan area that consists of areas in the union territory of Chandigarh, and the states of Punjab and Haryana.

Telephone numbers in IndonesiaLocationCountryIndonesiaContinentAsiaRegulatorKominfoTypeclosedAccess codesCountry code+62International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Indonesia have different systems for land lines and mobile phones: land lines use area codes, while mobile phones do not.
For land line area codes, the digit "0" is added in front when dialing domestic long distance from within Indonesia, but is always omitted when calling from abroad. Instead, callers would use the Indonesian country code +62, followed by the area code, without the "0". Domestic phone numbers in large cities have 8 digits, and in other areas 7 digits. Mobile phone numbers have a total of 10 to 12 digits for postpaid depending on the operator, whereas prepaid services get 11 to 13 digits determined by the operator.
Until October 1999, East Timor was included in the Indonesian telephone numbering plan, using the area codes 0390 (for Dili)[1] and 0399 (for Baucau).[2]
To make a phone call to Indonesia from abroad, the following formats are used:
For calls to landlines, callers dial +62, followed by the area code and subscriber's number, omitting the '0', hence a number in Jakarta would be dialled as +62 21-xxxx-xxxx. 
For calls to mobile wireless phone (GSM) from abroad, callers dial +62, followed by the subscriber's number, omitting the '0', hence +62 8xx-xxxx-xxxx

Numbers in business contact information[edit]
On business cards and other contact information, telephone numbers might be listed as "HP" or "hunting".  "HP" is an abbreviation for "hand phone" or mobile phone and is pronounced "hah péh".  Hand phones might also be referred to as pon-sel (short form of telepon seluler) or telepon genggam ("hold-in-the-hand telephone"). Hunting refers to an office line in which multiple individual lines are connected so that an incoming call can roll over to another line if the first line is busy.  This permits only one number to be published.

Number length[edit]
All telephone numbers are 11 digits long (initial 0 plus ten numbers). The first two or three digits after the zero are the area code. The possibilities are:  (0xx) xxxx xxxx (for landlines), 09xx xxx xxxx (for cellphones) and 099xx xxx xxx (for MVNO).
You can replace initial 0 with +98 too.
When making a call within the same landline area code, initial 0 plus the area code can be omitted.

Example for calling[edit]
The international call prefix depends on the country you are calling from; e.g., 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code. The prefix for international calls from Iran is 00 (e.g., for a United States number 00 1 ... should be dialed).
An example for calling telephones in the city of Tehran is as follows:

xxxx xxxx (within Tehran, via a landline)
021 xxxx xxxx (within Iran but either outside Tehran or via a cellphone)
+98 21 xxxx xxxx (outside Iran)
An example for mobile numbers is as follows:

09xx xxx xxxx (in Iran)
+98 9xx xxx xxxx (outside Iran)
Landlines[edit]
Originally, there was only one provider of landline telephony, Telecommunication Company of Iran.

Area code[edit]

If you intend to use your SIM card, make sure to put your phone on flight mode after using SIM cards from Iranian companies. Irancell, Hamrah Aval and RighTel are the main 3 phone operators in Iran. Fortunately the existing mobile network provides 4G & 5G cellular data coverage in all the small and big cities around the country. Also in most of the main roads between cities you can have access to call and data services.[1]
In order to identify mobile subscriber in a country, Mobile Network Code (MNC) are used.
MNC is allocated by the national regulator. (e.g. MNC for IR-MCI is 11)
The Home Network Identity (HNI) is the combination of the MCC and the MNC. This is the number which fully identifies a mobile subscriber. This combination is also known as the PLMN. (e.g. HNI for IR-MCI with MNC = 11 and MCC of Iran = 432 will be 43211)
There are 9 mobile phone providers in Iran, listed below.

Telephone numbers in IsraelLocationCountryIsraelContinentAsiaRegulatorIsraeli Ministry of CommunicationsTypeclosedNSN  length8 or 9 (landline)  10 (mobile)Format(0A) XXX-XXXX (landline)  05N-XXX-XXXX (mobile)Access codesCountry code+972International access00 or 01xLong-distance0
Telephone numbers in Israel consist of an area code and a subscriber number. The dial plan type in Israel is closed, and "0" is the internal trunk prefix in Israel. Israel's country calling code is +972.
When dialing an Israeli number from inside of Israel, the format is :
"0 - area/network operator code (A/N) - subscriber number (X)"
When dialing an Israeli number from outside Israel, the format is :
"+972 - area/network operator code (A/N) - subscriber number (X)"
The Israeli telecommunication infrastructure includes the Palestinian telecommunication system.


History[edit]
In 1965, many Israeli phone numbers had 6 digits, but some had 5, according to the Tel Aviv-area phone book.[1]  There were ten area codes at that time: 02 Jerusalem, Bet Shemesh; 03 Tel Aviv, Petah Tikva, Rehovot, Ashdod; 04 Haifa and western Galilee; 051 Ashkelon; 053 Netanya; 057 Beersheva and most of the Negev; 059 Eilat; 065 Afula, Nazareth; 063 Hadera, Zichron Yaakov; and 067 Tiberias, Zefat and eastern Galilee.[2]
As recently as the 1990s, most telephone numbers in Israel had 6 digits (without area code digit). Currently there are 5 geographic area codes and 2 more non-geographic area codes, and numbers have 7 or 8 digits (without area code digit).

Structure and format[edit]
The format for calls to landlines within the same area code is XXX-XXXX (7 digits subscriber number). For calls to a landline outside the local area, the area code is prefixed and the format becomes (0A) XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, where "0A" is the area code.
The format for calls to cellular mobile phones is 05N-XXX-XXXX, where "05N" is the mobile operator indicator. The format for calls to VoIP lines is 07N-XXX-XXXX, where "07N" is the VoIP operator indicator.
When calling from outside of Israel, the leading "0" in area codes is not dialed, and the format is +972-A-XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, +972-5N-XXX-XXXX for calls to mobile lines, +972-7N-XXX-XXXX for calls to VoIP lines.

00 or + – short code (only registered customers)
012 – 012smile service
013 – 013 NetVision service

015 – Hallo 015 service
016 – Golan Telecom service
017 – Hot Mobile service
018 – Xfone service

Geographic area codes[edit]
Geographic area codes of Israel
When dialing within one of the geographical area codes (2, 3, 4, 8, 9) the prefix can be dropped (so instead of dialing (0A)XXX-XXXX you can dial XXX-XXXX).

Kosher numbers[edit]
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Kosher phones and networks are essentially phones with Haredi rabbinical approval that can be used for communication without entertainment functionality or connectivity. This is a line that has a pre-defined
prefix and it is blocked to content that Haredi activists feel is not appropriate for their community.
Such blocking includes cellular internet access, chat rooms, SMS, etc.[11] This does not mean that other phones are not kosher according to Jewish law, as evidenced by the fact that a very large number - if not the majority - of observant Orthodox Jews worldwide do not restrict themselves to "kosher" phones; rather the description "kosher" phones is a loose one, implying an added level of stringency accepted by some communities.
The companies who provides "kosher numbers" allocated exclusive ranges for those lines, which are:

+972 (A) 80X-XXXX - Bezeq (When A = 2,3,4,8,9)
+972 50 41X-XXXX  - Pelephone

Telephone numbers in Italy are managed by the Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM), a national regulatory authority for the communication industry located in Rome.
Italian telephone numbers are defined by an open telephone numbering plan that assigns subscriber telephone numbers of six to eleven digits. In addition, other short codes are used for special services. The plan is organized by types of services,[1] indicated by the first digit. Geographic landline numbers start with the digit 0, while mobile telephone numbers start with 3. Four types of emergency services use three-digit telephone numbers in the group 11X, including 112 for the Carabinieri.[2]  Other initial digits denote other services, such as toll-free numbers.
The dialing procedures for callers mandate that the full telephone number is always dialed, including the area code, which is called prefix (prefisso in Italian). Since 1998, the leading 0 of landline numbers has to be included also when calling from abroad, in contrast with the practice in many other countries.
The country code for calling Italy from abroad is 39.[3] For calling foreign destinations from Italy, the international call prefix is 00, as is standard in most European countries.
Italian regulations prescribe no fixed rules for grouping the digits of telephone numbers for printing or display. Various grouping schemes are commonly used and a telephone number is likely to be written or pronounced differently by different people. Commonly used formatting or punctuation characters include the space character, the dot, full stop, and the hyphen.


Number format[edit]
The minimum length of telephone numbers is three digits and the maximum is twelve.[1]

Landline service[edit]
Landline numbers start with the digit 0 and are 6 to 11 digits long, although they are rarely shorter than 9. They are composed of a variable length prefix followed by a variable length subscriber number.
Prefixes are assigned on a geographical basis, starting from the north of the country; for example: Rome has prefix "06", Milan has "02", Naples has "081", and Turin has "011".[4]

Mobile telephone service[edit]
Mobile telephone numbers start with the digit 3 and are generally ten digits long. It is still possible, but rare, to find nine-digit numbers, which were the first to be assigned.
The group of the first three digits of a mobile telephone number (prefix) identifies the mobile network operator that assigned the number, but since 2002, mobile number portability is possible and thus any number can end up being managed by any carrier.
Some network operators allow the caller to insert additional digits for redirecting calls to voice mail. For example, dialing, "36 339 7550176" might connect to the voice mail service of the telephone number "339 7550176".[5] The extra digits vary based on the network operator managing the service.

Emergency and service numbers[edit]
Emergency and service numbers start with the digit 1. Four emergency numbers are currently in use, but a process has been started to consolidate them with 112, previously assigned to the gendarmerie, already the unique emergency number in some areas.[6][7] Calls to 112 are answered within seconds and in multiple languages.[2]
The complete list of emergency numbers is:

"112": Gendarmerie (Carabinieri)[2][8]
"113": State Police (Polizia di Stato)[2][8]
"114": Helpline for children, handled by "SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus"[9]
"115": National Fire Department (Vigili del Fuoco)[2][8]
"118": Regional Emergency Medical Service[2][8]
Other service numbers are:

"10...": Carrier selection codes, to be prepended to the dialed number;
"116000": Hotline for missing children, handled by "SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus";[10]
"117": Financial Gendarmerie (Guardia di Finanza);[8]
"12xx": Directory services;
"1240": Pronto Pagine Bianche, service provided by Italiaonline;[11]
"1254": Directory service provided by Telecom Italia, major national operator;
"15xx": Public utility services;
"1515": Fire department (forestry), handled by Corpo Forestale dello Stato;[8]
"1525": Environmental emergencies;
"1518": Road information, handled by CCISS;[8]
"1530": Maritime assistance and rescue, handled by Italian Navy Coast Guard;
"194...": Customer care services;
"19696": Helpline for children, handled by "SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus";[12]
Special-rate numbers[edit]
Special-rate numbers start with 8 and include toll-free numbers (called green numbers, numeri verdi in Italian, starting with "80..."), shared-rate numbers ("84...") and premium-rate services ("89...").

Other numbers[edit]
Numbers starting with 4 are used for network-specific phone services like voice mailbox and various information services; they can be free, non-premium or premium.
Included in this category are, among others:

"40...": free operator internal services;
"455...": fundraising services for social purposes by non-profit agencies, organizations and associations and government;
"47...": mass call services;
The digit 5 has been reserved for VoIP numbers. 
Finally 7 is used for internet services such as virtual fax numbers and dial up internet access ("70...").

Unassigned numbers[edit]
Numbers starting with the digits 2, 6 and 9 are currently unassigned and reserved for future purposes.

Historical number formats[edit]
Trunk code removal[edit]
In the past it was possible to omit the prefix when calling from a landline to another landline in the same area. The digit "0" was the trunk code and it had to be removed when calling from abroad.[13]
This changed in 1998, with a transition period lasting from 19 June to 31 December. The new dialing procedures require dialing the full number for all calls. The main advantage is the availability of millions of previously reserved phone numbers.[13] The change was widely advertised with a campaign named "Fissa il prefisso" ("Attach the prefix").[13]
It was originally intended to replace the leading 0 with 4 for landlines. This was scheduled for implementation commencing 29 December 2000, but never happened. Instead, 4 was assigned to identify network services.
Example for calling the landline subscriber number xxxxxxxx in Rome:

xxxxxxxx: from within Rome, before 1998;
06xxxxxxxx: from within Rome, after 1998;
06xxxxxxxx: from outside Rome, both before and after 1998;
+396xxxxxxxx: from abroad, before 1998;
+3906xxxxxxxx: from abroad, after 1998.
Mobile numbers prefix shortening[edit]
Until 2001 a leading "0" was part of any mobile phone number, but it has been removed.[14]
Example for calling the mobile phone number 3xxxxxxxxx:

03xxxxxxxxx: from within Italy, before 2001;
3xxxxxxxxx: from within Italy, after 2001;
+393xxxxxxxxx: from abroad, both before and after 2001.
Other changes[edit]
Several other smaller changes occurred over the years: for example the prefix for toll free numbers changed from "167" to "800" in 1999.[15]

"116": Used to be assigned to Road help (ACI); It has changed to 803116. Some new number starting with 116 has been assigned to special services (for example the 116000 for missing children, already described above, or the 116117 assigned to non-urgent medical assistance[16])
Special relations with other countries[edit]
Campione d'Italia[edit]
The Italian municipality Campione d'Italia, an exclave within the Swiss canton of Ticino, uses the Swiss telephone network and is part of the Swiss numbering plan, with local numbers using the +41 91 numbering range, although some Italian numbers are in use by the municipal council, which use the same +39 031 numbering range as the town of Como.[17]

San Marino[edit]
Main article: Telephone numbers in San Marino
The Italian enclave San Marino has its own country code 378, but landline numbers can be reached using the Italian country code as well: the prefix "0549" is assigned to San Marino. Dialing either "+378 xxxxxx" or "+39 0549 xxxxxx" will reach the same number. Mobile phone customers are sometimes assigned Italian phone numbers.

Vatican City[edit]
Main article: Telephone numbers in Vatican City
The country code 379 is assigned to Vatican City, but it is not used: telephone numbers in Vatican City are integrated into the Italian numbering plan. Vatican landline telephone numbers are in the form "+39 06 698xxxxx", "+39" being the country code for Italy and "06" the prefix for Rome.

Geographic numbers are nine digits long, including the area code, but not including the leading zero. Consequently, densely populated areas have shorter area codes, while less populated areas have longer area codes. For example:

6 xxxx xxxx (Osaka)
75 xxx xxxx (Kyoto)
742 xx xxxx (Nara)
4992 x xxxx (Niijima island, Tokyo pref.)
82486  xxxx (Takano, Hiroshima pref.)
Area codes increase from north to south; Sapporo in Hokkaidō (the northernmost prefecture) has 11, and Setouchi's 99-73 is far to the south in Kagoshima.  When the telephone system was devised, Okinawa was still under U.S. occupation, so when it was returned to Japan in 1972, its telephone numbers were squeezed between Miyazaki (98x) and Kagoshima (99x) and begin with 988, 989, and 980.
During the 1990s, when plans were being drawn up to amalgamate mid-sized cities and towns into larger municipalities, telephone numbering systems were merged in advance.  For example,

7442 x xxxx Kashihara (Nara prefecture)
7444 x xxxx Sakurai
74452 xxxx Takatori
74454 xxxx Asuka etc.
became:

744 2x xxxx Kashihara
744 4x xxxx Sakurai
744 52 xxxx Takatori
744 54 xxxx Asuka etc.
Many of these towns have in fact refused to merge, leaving callers with more digits to dial when making local calls.  This is partially balanced by not having to dial an area code for the neighboring city.

Area code as local brand naming[edit]
Flea Market event named "028 Market" held on the Union St. in Utsunomiya. This event is held about once in a half year.
After entering the 2010s, local products and events have begun using names which come from the area code.[citation needed]
0465net (Odawara, Kanagawa)
0428 T-shirt (Ome, Tokyo)
028 Market (Utsunomiya, Tochigi)
028 Machinaka (Inner-City) Wi-Fi (Utsunomiya, Tochigi) 
Bar 053 (Hamamatsu, Shizuoka)

Kenya telephone calling codes


Telephone numbers in KenyaLocationCountryKenyaContinentAfricaRegulatorCommunications Authority of Kenya (CA)TypeClosedNSN  length9Access codesCountry code+254International access000Long-distance0
The following telephone numbers in Kenya are destination codes for international calls terminating in Kenya as well as the procedures for dialling internationally from within Kenya. Until 1999, Kenya shared its telephone numbering plan with Tanzania and Uganda, meaning that to make calls between the three countries, subscribers needed only dial the area code and number, a legacy of the East African Post and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC) which was dissolved in 1977. As a result of the reorganisation of Tanzania's numbering plan in that year, direct dialling was discontinued, although calls between the three countries do not require international dialling, only a special three-digit code.


Land lines[edit]
Land line phone numbers in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number.
To dial a number within an area or city, only the phone number needs to be dialled.  When dialling from a different area or city, the telephone number is dialled in the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. When dialling from abroad, the 0 is omitted.

Mobile operators[edit]
In Kenya there are four[1] mobile network operators (MNO): Safaricom, Airtel (former Zain / Celtel),  Equitel (MVNO) and Telkom Kenya (Orange).[2] The Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) has assigned several Area Codes to each operator. All mobile Area Codes used the start with the digit 7. As of May 2019, the Communications authority introduced codes starting with the digit 1.[3] Please note: Since April 2011 Mobile number portability (MNP) is implemented in Kenya.[4] The phone number can be ported by the customer to another operator.

Telephone numbers in KosovoLocation of Kosovo (dark green)LocationCountryKosovoContinentEuropeRegulatorARKEP / Republic of KosovoTypeOpenFormat04x xxx xxxAccess codesCountry code+383International access00Long-distance0
The dialing code for Kosovo is +383. It was assigned by the ITU following an agreement between the authorities of Kosovo and Serbia in an EU-led dialogue.[1] Its dialing code was initially expected to become effective on 1 January 2015, but it was postponed to the finalization of the agreement in late August 2015.[2] With the agreement of the Administration of the Republic of Serbia, the Director of TSB has assigned the international codes to Kosovo.[3] Kosovo is represented in ITU as Kosovo* which the designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.[4] The EU has handed over[clarification needed] the temporary authorisation for mobile and the licence for fixed telephony services to be undertaken in Kosovo issued by the Kosovo Telecommunication Regulatory Authority to mts d.o.o.[5]


History[edit]
Following the breakup of the SFR Yugoslavia in 1992, which had +38 as country code, Kosovo used the code +381, which was granted to FR Yugoslavia and later used by Serbia. The code was used for fixed line telephone services, whereas for mobile phone networks, it used either the Monaco code +377 or the Slovenian code +386.[6] The new calling code +383 began its use in early 2017.

Reactions to +383 code allocation[edit]
The International Telecommunication Union "will not recognize Kosovo's independence", quote daily Koha Ditore, "as ITU will include the footnote on Kosovo" in the technical annexes. Kosovo's NISMA party leader Fatmir Limaj was quoted by KosovaPress agency to have said that with the agreement reached in Brussels, the Kosovo government "allowed the Serbian operator to work in Kosovo".[8] Vice chairman of Kosovo's Vetëvendosje party, Shpend Ahmeti claimed that the agreement favored Serbia. "Telephone calls between cities in Serbia and cities in Kosovo will be treated as local calls. Serbia will preserve its assets in Kosovo and it will also have a license for Serb operators within Kosovo. For these favors, Serbia will allow Kosovo to have its own country code."[9]

Telephone numbers in KuwaitLocationCountryKuwaitContinentAsiaTypeclosedAccess codesCountry code+965International access00Long-distancenone
There is no area code in Kuwait. As of 17 October 2008, telephone numbers in Kuwait consist of eight digits (with the exception of '800'-style numbers, which are made up of seven digits). From 17 October 2008 a single digit prefix was added to all fixed and mobile numbers as per the Ministry of Communication's new numbering plan:

Number 1 was added before all commercial 6 digit numbers (e.g. 800000, 899999, etc.)
Number 2 was added before all landline numbers
Number 41 was allocated for Virgin Mobile numbers (year 2022)
Number 5 was added before all STC numbers
Number 6 was added before all Ooredoo Telecom - Formerly Wataniya Telecom numbers
Number 9 was added before all Zain numbers
All the three digit lines remained the same without any additional number e.g. 121, 107, 113, 112, etc.
On June 15, 2013 the Kuwait's Ministry of Communications (MoC) has announced the launch of mobile number portability (MNP), a service that allows mobile users to change their service provider without the need to change their mobile number.
Here are the starting codes of landlines sorted by each area or city:

Before 2012, dialing to other provinces is 101, then wait for operator, the same thing as to other countries, but to other countries is 100. Before 2012, mobile phones are already allowed to dial to other provinces/countries directly.

Telephone numbers in LatviaLocation of Latvia (dark green)LocationCountryLatviaContinentEuropeRegulatorPublic Utilities CommissionTypeClosedNSN  length8, with some exceptionsFormatVariousAccess codesCountry code+371[1]International access00Long-distanceNone
The Latvian telephone numbering plan is a telephone number assigning system used in Latvia. All the numbers consist of 8 digits with exceptions for special services. The assigning process is controlled by the Electronic Communications Office (Latvian: VAS "Elektroniskie sakari") and regulated by the Public Utilities Commission (Latvian: Sabiedrisko pakalpojumu regulēšanas komisija).[2]


Format[edit]
The Latvian SSR had the +7 013 area code. The original format was 8 (013) xxx xxxx. In 1993, Latvia switched to the +371 code. The plan remained relatively the same until 2008, when a 6 was prepended to all landlines.
Example number in Riga:

pre-1993: 8 (013) 678 9012
1993-2008: 678 9012
2008–present: 6678 9012
Mobile telephones[edit]

Geographic numbering[edit]

The 5-series is currently only reserved for future use. The 6-series is generally used for landlines and the 7-series is used with payphones throughout the country.

The following are the telephone numbers in Lesotho. Lesotho was allocated the country code +266 by the International Telecommunication Union in the late 1960s.[2]
Phone numbers in  are eight digits long, the first two digits being the area code. Previously, Lesotho had area codes, which were integrated into the South African telephone numbering plan, and calls could be made from South Africa using the regional code 050.[3] For example, to call a number in Maseru, subscribers would dial 0501, while to call a number in Mazenod, they would dial 05022.[4] From the rest of the world, subscribers would dial +266 1.[5]


Area codes[edit]
22,28 Maseru Reserved for fixed
56,57,58,59,63, Reserved for cellular use
27,52 Reserved for fixed mobile (corporated direct)
6x Reserved for cellular use
Errata[edit]
There had been some interest in using part of this country's numbering scheme to run international SMS promotions or competitions, as when +CNN is spelt out on an E.161 standard telephone keypad, it translates to +266.[6] CNN's degree of interest in the idea was unknown at the time.

Liechtenstein previously used the Swiss telephone numbering plan (+41) under area code 075.[1] (This was dialled as +41 75 from outside Switzerland and Liechtenstein).[2] However, on 5 April 1999, it adopted its own international code +423.[3] Consequently, calls from Switzerland now require international dialling, using the 00423 prefix and the seven-digit number.[4]

Telephone numbers in LithuaniaLocationCountryLithuaniaContinentEuropeNSN  length8Format(8x) xxx xxxx(8xx) xx xxxx(8xxx) xxxxxAccess codesCountry code+370International access00Long-distance8
Lithuania uses an open telephone numbering plan with all phone numbers having nine digits, including the prefix "8", a 1–3 digit area code, and a 5–7 digit subscriber telephone number. The current plan was introduced in stages in 2001–2003, replacing Soviet-legacy area codes and altering some subscriber numbers.[1][2]


Overview[edit]
Lithuania uses a total of 47 area codes for landline phones, all beginning with 3, 4 or 5. Within same area code, landlines can be dialed without the prefix and the area code.[3]
Area codes for mobile numbers begin with 6, corporate or state institution numbers with 7, toll-free, reverse-charge and shared-cost numbers with 8, and premium-rate numbers with 9.[3]
Network services numbers begin with "1", dialed without a prefix. This includes numbers beginning with "11", reserved for emergency and special services, such as:

112 – National emergency number
113 – Non-emergency medical number
116 xxx – Harmonised services of social value
117 – Telecommunication helpline
118 – Directory assistance
119 – Fault registration
Prefixes[edit]
Lithuania uses area code prefix "8", inherited from Soviet times and not changed during the 2002 changeover.[3]
It intends to change the prefix to "0", as used in many European countries.[3] The "0" prefix was not available due to delays rolling out the national emergency line 112, which kept Soviet-legacy emergency numbers 01, 02 and 03 in place until 1 April 2022.[4] In January 2023, Lithuanian authorities announced that the area code prefix would change in December 2025, pending a consultation.[5] The next month, Lithuanian authorities further announced that a permissive dialing period would begin in March 2024, and that beginning March 2025, the use of area code prefix "0" will become mandatory, with an information message being given to those who continue to dial in the old format through December.[6]
International dialling prefix "00" replaced Soviet-era 8~10 in 2003.
Lithuania uses +370 country calling code since 1993, replacing area code in Soviet-numbering space +7 012.

Telephone numbers in LuxembourgLocationCountryLuxembourgContinentEuropeAccess codesCountry code+352International access00Long-distancenone
Telephone numbers in Luxembourg employ a closed dialling system, whereby all numbers are dialed in the same format whether from within Luxembourg or from abroad. There is no trunk prefix like "0".
The incumbent operator employed an open numbering plan with numbers of varying lengths, where a two-digit area identifier is followed by one to four digits, all six digits forming the subscriber number. This was changed by the introduction of a new numbering plan in 1999.[1] Telephone numbers introduced since May 2000 by the incumbent operator begin with "2" (generally 26, 24 and recently 27[2]) followed by two to six digits. The area identifier is still present and generally following the 26, 27 or 24, however numbers can be ported to any other area.

79 xxxx           (example number in Consdorf)
+352 79 xxxx        (when dialed from outside Luxembourg)
2679 xxxx           (example number in Consdorf for new lines since May 2000)
+352 2679 xxxx        (when dialed from outside Luxembourg)
4 xxx xx      (example number in Luxembourg City)
+352 4 xxx xx   (when dialed from outside Luxembourg)
In Luxembourg, PBX extensions were generally appended to the main number, hence the need for an open numbering plan. As more PBXs were installed in offices in Luxembourg compared to areas with almost exclusively residential customers, this led to the impression that numbers in Luxembourg City would be longer than six digits. The regulator therefore decided that new phone numbers must be eight digits long including the extension. In order to fulfill this requirement, operators have to shorten a customer's phone number to 3-6 digits, to allow 2-5 digit extensions.

Mobile Numbers[edit]
Mobile telephone numbers always carry a three-digit network code, in the format "6x1", which is followed by six digits. The leading "6" of these numbers is not omitted when dialing from abroad.

6x1 xxx xxx       (within Luxembourg)
+352 6x1 xxx xxx    (outside Luxembourg)
These codes were introduced on 1 September 2006, replacing codes in the format "0x1". Existing numbers were converted to the new format.
Starting January 2019, the voice mail number is generic, reachable only from the subscriber itself (or as result of the call forwarding when busy/non reachable ...):
352691000700
Until January 2019, the voice mail number followed the below rule:
Each mobile number has an equivalent voicemail number, the network code is in the format "6x8" (note: except for Join Experience, they are not using it).
The mobile network codes are:

621: POST Telecom (formerly LuxGSM)
651: Eltrona (mvno on POST Telecom), starting 2017
661: Orange Luxembourg
671: Join Experience
691: Tango Mobile
In June 2009,[3] a new numbering range for mobile machine-to-machine communication was introduced. The numbers have a fixed length of 12 digits and start with "60", the only assigned network code from this range is:

6021: POST Telecom (formerly LuxGSM)

Telephone numbers in Macau are eight-digit numbers. Fixed land line numbers start with 28, while mobile (cellular) phone numbers start with 6. Calls from Macau to mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Portugal are treated as international calls.
The telephone number for emergency services – Police, Fire Service and Ambulance – is 999 for all telephone lines. In addition to 999, two more emergency hotline numbers 110 (mainly for tourists from mainland China) and 112 (mainly for tourists from overseas) can be dialed, however calls made to 110 and 112 are redirected to the 999 call centre. 993 is used for the reporting of serious crimes to Polícia Judiciária (Judiciary Police) for investigation, use this hotline for organised crime reporting, gambling crimes, homicide and drug transport.


Government regulator[edit]
Prior to 1999 telephone regulation was under the Direcção dos Serviços de Correios e Telecomunicações (CTT) or Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones under the Secretary for Transport and Public Works.
Since 1999 telephone numbers are under the responsibility of the Direcção dos Serviços de Regulação de Telecomunicações (DSRT) or Bureau of Telecommunications Regulation under the Secretariat for Transport and Public Works.

Madagascar telephone calling codes
Telephone numbers in MadagascarLocationCountryMadagascarContinentAfricaNSN  length7Access codesCountry code+261International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Madagascar are seven digits long, the first two digits being an area code.
Recent ITU documents suggest the area code is preceded by a two digit operator code, for example "20" for Telecom Malagasy.


International numbering plan[edit]
International numbering format: +261 AB Z PQMCDU[1]
where:

+261 international prefix
AB operator code (two digits for each operator)
Z area code (described as administrative area)
PQMCDU subscriber number
Country code 261
Country code 261 for all existing telecommunication networks in Madagascar.
AB – operator code
Each operator is identified by two digits described by the characters AB:
20-29 identification code for fixed service operators,
30-39 identification code for mobile service operators
Z – area code valid for Telecom Malagasy (fixed-service operator)
Madagascar is divided into six zones:
Z = 2 Antananarivo zone
Z = 4 Antananarivo zone (rest of the province)
Z = 5 Toamasina zone
Z = 6 Mahajanga zone
Z = 7 Fianarantsoa zone
Z = 8 Antsiranana zone
Z = 9 Toliara zone
National numbering plan[edit]
At national level, a closed numbering system of seven digits is used. That is, all subscriber numbers requested to the same operator Telecom Malagasy (local and national) can be obtained by dialling seven digits (ZPQMCDU).

Telephone numbers in Malaysia are regulated by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).
Landline telephone numbers consist of an area code of 1 to 2 digits (excluding the leading zero), followed by a 6 to 8-digit subscriber number. Mobile phone numbers consist of a mobile phone code of 2 digits followed by a 7- to 8-digit subscriber number. Mobile phone codes are originally assigned to specific mobile network operators; however, with mobile number portability, a mobile phone number might no longer be associated with its original assigned operator.
Until 2017, calls to Singapore did not require international dialling; they were made using the 02 domestic access code. However, following a directive from MCMC, it was discontinued in stages in May and June 2017. It was discontinued early on 16 May 2017 by Telekom Malaysia, and discontinued entirely by other Malaysian telecommunications companies on 1 July 2017. The normal international prefix of +65 has been made mandatory after that date.[1][2] Similarly, calls to Brunei from East Malaysia can be made using the 080 domestic access code, but calls from Peninsular Malaysia to Brunei require the international prefix 00673.


Landline area codes[edit]
Landline area codes are, excluding the STD prefix 0, one digit in Peninsular Malaysia (area codes 3 to 7 and 9) and two digits in East Malaysia (area codes 8x). In Peninsular Malaysia, an area code is usually shared by multiple states and territories and roughly follows state borders. The two East Malaysian states, Sabah and Sarawak, are split into multiple area codes.
Landline subscriber numbers are seven digits in Peninsular Malaysia (except Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, i.e. area code 3) and six digits in East Malaysia. Until 1995, subscriber numbers in Peninsular Malaysia were six digits in areas other than area code 3. Prior to 2001, subscriber numbers were seven digits in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. From 1999 to 2001, subscriber numbers in these areas were gradually expanded to eight digits in phases to meet new demands that resulted from the growing population in the Klang Valley.
Thus, a full national number is 10 digits in area code 3 and 9 digits elsewhere, including the STD prefix 0. When writing a telephone number with the area code, the area code and subscriber number is separated with a hyphen. Examples:

A number 2xxx xxxx in Kuala Lumpur: 03-2xxx xxxx
A number 2xx xxxx in George Town, Penang: 04-2xx xxxx
A number 2xx xxxx in Johor Bahru, Johor: 07-2xx xxxx
A number 2x xxxx in Kuching, Sarawak: 082-2x xxxx
When calling from a landline, calls to landlines within the same area code do not require the area code to be dialled. Calls to and from mobile phones require full national dialling codes.
e.g. When calling a number 2xxx xxxx in Kuala Lumpur (03) from a landline:

Within Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya: 2xxx xxxx
Outside Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, Within Malaysia: 03-2xxx xxxx
Outside Malaysia: +60-3-2xxx xxxx (the initial 0 of the area code is omitted)

Mobile phone codes and IP telephony[edit]
Mobile phone codes and IP telephony codes are in the area code 1, ranging 2 digits excluding the leading zero.
Subscriber number length is seven- or eight-digit, depending on the mobile phone code. Numbers in the 011 and 015 codes are eight digits long, while all other numbers are seven digits long. Therefore, a full national number (including the leading zero) is 11 digits long for 011 and 015 numbers, and 10 digits long for all other numbers.
Calling to and from mobile phones always require full national dialling, even with mobile phones in the same mobile phone code. When calling from outside Malaysia, the leading zero is dropped. For example, a number 016-xxx xxxx is dialled as +60-16-xxx xxxx from outside Malaysia.
Originally, each mobile phone operator was issued one mobile phone code. Through a series of mergers, there were three major mobile phone operators: Celcom, Maxis and Digi as of 2005. As existing numbers began to run out, the three mobile phone operators were assigned numbers in 014 code distinguished by the first digit of the seven-digit subscriber number.
With the proliferation of new mobile virtual network operators and the exhaustion of existing codes, two new ranges 011 and 015 are made available for assignment. Subscriber numbers are eight digits long, resulting in an 11-digit mobile number including the leading zero. 011-1 was made available to mobile phone operators starting 15 December 2010.[3] The two major ISPs in Malaysia, TMNet and Jaring are assigned numbers in the 015-4 prefix to provide VoIP (also known as Telephony Service over IP, TSoIP) service. New numbers are assigned in smaller blocks of 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000 numbers, as opposed to the previous practice of assigning a whole prefix to an operator, which is a block of nearly 8,000,000 numbers.
The advent of mobile number portability means the current operator of a particular mobile phone number is not necessarily the original assigned operator of the number.

Mobile Number portability[edit]
Mobile number portability was introduced on 1 October 2008 for mobile phone numbers in a bid to increase market competition. Thus, subscribers are allowed to retain their mobile numbers when they switch to another service provider. Therefore, the mobile number prefix only indicates the original service provider.
Number portability has not been offered for landlines, as Telekom Malaysia (TM) holds a monopoly on landlines except in Putrajaya and some areas in the Klang Valley.

Malta adopted a new telephone numbering plan in 2001–2002, in which telephone numbers were expanded to eight digits for fixed line and mobile numbers. Previously, fixed line numbers were six digits, while mobile, mailbox and pager services were seven digits long.

Geographic numbering[edit]
The prefix 21 was added to GO fixed line numbers.

Non-geographic numbering[edit]
The prefix 9 for seven-digit Epic mobile phone numbers was changed to 99.

       9xx xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
      99xx xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
 +356 99xx xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)

The prefix 09 for Vodafone mobile phone numbers was changed to 99.
Mobile phone numbers with the prefix 09, which were already eight digits, changed to 99. The digit 0 was to be dialled from outside Malta as well as domestically.

      09xx xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
      99xx xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
 +356 09xx xxxx (before 2002, outside Malta)
 +356 99xx xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)

Other non-geographic number ranges also changed, with the prefix for seven-digit mailbox numbers changing from 07 to 217.

          07x xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
         217x xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)

Telephone numbers in MexicoLocationCountryMexicoContinentNorth AmericaFormat+52XXXXXXXXXXAccess codesCountry code52
Telephone numbers in Mexico are regulated by the Federal Telecommunications Institute, an independent government agency of Mexico. The agency published the Fundamental Technical Plan for Numbering (Plan Técnico Fundamental de Numeración) on May 11, 2013.[1] The plan establishes a uniform ten-digit telephone number format. It took effect on August 3, 2019.[2]


Telephone number format[edit]
All telephone numbers in Mexico have ten digits, of which the first identifies one of the eight principal geographic regions of the country.

The national number is formed by prefixing the previously existing local number format with an area code.[2] All ten digits must be dialed for all calls.

Dialing prefixes[edit]
Since August 3, 2019, only the following dialing prefixes are available for use within Mexico:



Prefix

Format

International direct dialing

00 + country code + local phone number


Dialing into Mexico[edit]
Destinations in Mexico are dialed from foreign location by dialing the foreign country's International access code (011 in the US, 00 in many other countries), the country code 52, and the ten-digit national telephone number of the destination.

History[edit]
Until August 3, 2019, telephone numbers in Mexico consisted of ten digits with either two-digit area codes (for Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara and their respective metropolitan areas) or three-digit area codes for the rest of the country. New area codes were assigned in the overlay format to address number exhaustion: in 2017, Toluca and Puebla and in 2018, León, Mexico City, and Tijuana.
In the early development of International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD), Mexico elected to join World Zone 5, instead of joining the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).[3] Since the 1960s, the Bell System had already established technical infrastructure to include Mexico in the NANP routing system, and continued to maintain special dialing arrangement using NANP area codes 903 (northwest Mexico) and 905 (Mexico City) from the US into Mexico,[4] because of high community interest into the 1980s. Use of the area codes was formally discontinued on February 1, 1991, requiring callers to use international dialing.[5][6]

Area codes[edit]
Major cities and metropolitan areas have the following codes:

On February 1, 2004 Moldova introduced a new closed telephone numbering plan with an open dialing plan.[1] The country code is +373, adopted in 1993.[2] Previously, when Moldova was part of the Soviet Union, it used the country code +7 and the area code 0422.[3]


Numbering scheme[edit]
Telephone numbers in Moldova follow an open numbering plan and consist of 8 national significant numbers (NSN). The National Significant Number consists of 2-3 digits for the National Destination Code and 5-6 digits for the Subscriber Number (SN).

Telephone numbers in Monaco are eight digits in length, with fixed line numbers beginning with the digit 9 and mobile phone numbers with the digit 6.[1]


Overview[edit]
Until 21 June 1996, Monaco formed part of the French numbering plan, with fixed line numbers beginning with 93.[2] On that date the Principality adopted its own country code +377.[3] Consequently, all calls between France and Monaco had to be dialled in international format, including those to and from surrounding areas in France.[4]

Mobile phone operators in at least two other jurisdictions, specifically Lonestar Cell in Liberia[5][6] and Vala in Kosovo,[7] have also used the +377 dialing code. Vala's use of +377 ceased on 3 February 2017, when Kosovo implemented the +383 code.[8]

Telephone numbers in MontenegroLocation of Montenegro (dark green)LocationCountryMontenegroContinentEuropeRegulatorAgency of Telecommunications of MontenegroTypeOpenFormat0XX XXX XXXAccess codesCountry code+382International access00Long-distance0
This is a list of dialing codes by town in Montenegro.


History[edit]
Until Montenegro gained independence from Serbia and Montenegro, the nation was accessed through the international dialing code +381. The new dialing code +382 was introduced after independence and the two codes were used in parallel until February 2007, when +382 nominally became the only acceptable code. As of 1 October 2007, +381 is used only for Serbia and +382 is the only acceptable code for Montenegro.

Dialing codes[edit]
Fixed telephony[edit]
Area codes have two digits after the initial '0' trunk prefix, and local numbers have six digits. The trunk prefix is omitted when calling from abroad.
The following code prefixes are used for network groups.[1]
The old codes were used in parallel with the new codes until 1 October 2008:[citation needed]

Telephone numbers in MoroccoLocationCountryMoroccoContinentAfricaNSN  length9Format0xxx-xxxxxxAccess codesCountry code+212International access00Long-distance0
All phone numbers in Morocco are 9 digits in length (excluding the leading 0).
Morocco uses a closed numbering plan, i.e. the prefix is not omitted for local calls. This is necessary because the same geographic area can be served by several prefixes. Casablanca, for instance, has 10 prefixes.
Fixed and mobile prefixes belong exclusively to one phone company. On the following list, fixed networks are indicated by the following letters:
I = Maroc Telecom (fixed), O = Orange Maroc (NGN), W = INWI (Maroc Connect) (fixed NGN), X = INWI (Maroc Connect) (fixed GSM(?))


List[edit]
The disputed territory of Western Sahara de facto uses the ranges owned by Morocco. The ranges in Western Sahara are +212 5288-XXXXX, and +212 5289-XXXXX.

History[edit]
1990 - Transition to 6-digit numbers[edit]
In 1990, 6-digit phone numbers were introduced.

199x - Transition from 6-digit to 7-digit numbers[edit]
This section is empty.  You can help by adding to it.  (January 2011)
2000 - Transition from 7-digit to 8-digit numbers[edit]
On 2000-10-13 at 23:00 UTC, the numbering area in Morocco was split into 5 parts by adding another digit to all area codes in Morocco.

2006 - Merger of 04 into 02 and 05 into 03[edit]
Six years later (2006-03-24 23:00 UTC), part of this split was reverted in order to make room for cellular networks. The 04 numbering area was merged into 02 and 05 was merged into 03, which caused 02 to cover the South while 03 covered the North. This could be done easily because there were no conflicts.

2009 - Transition from 8-digit to 9-digit numbers[edit]
On 2009-03-07 at 02:00 UTC, phone numbers in Morocco got another additional digit. A 5 was prepended to all fixed numbers while a 6 was prepended to mobile numbers. The 08 numbers became 080 and 09 became 089.

Namibia telephone calling codes
Telephone numbers in NamibiaLocation of Namibia in AfricaLocationCountryNamibiaContinentAfricaAccess codesCountry code+264International access00Long-distance0
Namibia's telephone numbering plan was originally devised when the country, then known as South West Africa, was under South African administration, and integrated into the South African telephone numbering plan.[1]
Area codes beginning with 06 were  allocated to Namibia, including Walvis Bay, a South African exclave, which was not transferred to Namibian sovereignty until 1994.
Following Namibia's independence in 1990, direct dialing between Namibia and South Africa was discontinued, and calls were classed as international. Consequently, subscribers were required to use the international access code and country calling code, omitting the trunk code 0. Namibia had already been allocated its own country code by the International Telecommunication Union, +264, in the late 1960s.[2]

The New Zealand telephone numbering plan describes the allocation of telephone numbers in New Zealand and the Pitcairn Islands.


History[edit]
By the 1970s, New Zealand's telephone network consisted primarily of step-by-step telephone exchanges or, in the main centres, a mixture of rotary and step-by-step exchanges, with a few rural areas still served by manual exchanges. Local telephone number lengths varied from 3 to 6 digits depending on the size of exchange and population of the local calling area. Numerous complex dialling instructions appeared in the front of telephone books explaining the number sequences needed to reach subscribers in local "free calling" areas, and in a few cases for short-distance toll calls (usually to the local city or town), which were recorded on manually read metres in some step-by-step local exchanges. Local calls were free (and still are for residential customers). Long distance (toll) calls required the manual intervention of an operator, who had access to toll circuits, either via an operator's cord board or a toll exchange (switch). Access to the toll operator was by dialling 0. Local directory service could be accessed via 100, telephone faults via 120, and emergency services by dialling 111.
Crossbar exchanges were installed from the 1970s, and electronic exchanges from 1982.

Subscriber toll dialling (the historical codes)[edit]
Subscriber toll dialling (STD) was introduced in the New Zealand telephone network in the mid-to-late 1970s, a result of the introduction of NEC crossbar-based toll exchanges and their ability to perform number translation. Upper Hutt was the first exchange to implement STD, on 9 April 1976.[1] One still needed to dial 0 to make a toll call, but instead of calling the operator, one could then dial the STD number directly. Access to the operator was via 010, while other service numbers remained unchanged.
The original STD codes were numbered roughly south to north, with a few exceptions. A complete list of STD codes from 1987 is below:

STD codes were assigned with larger areas having short STD codes (e.g. Auckland - 09), while smaller areas had longer STD codes and shorter local numbers (e.g. Shannon - 06927). The total number length, that is STD code and local number excluding the first 0, usually totalled seven digits, but could vary up to nine, as exchanges often increased the length of local numbers to accommodate new lines.

Reorganisation[edit]
With the introduction of NEC stored program control exchanges in the New Zealand telephone network during the 1980s, and the rapid growth in demand, the breakup of the New Zealand Post Office and the creation of Telecom, local telephone numbers were standardised to seven digits. In many parts of the country, the old area code was incorporated into the new number, however in some areas the numbers changed completely.

At the same time, the opportunity was taken to move directory service from 100 to 018 and charge for directory service calls. The justification for doing so was the introduction of a directory service computer system that gave access to current New Zealand telephone number listings, not just those printed in the telephone book, and the need for a separate user pays revenue stream for Telecom Directory Services, which was separate to the 5 regional (local) telephone companies, TNI and Telecom Mobile that Telecom had split itself into, as part of the sale of Telecom and deregulation of New Zealand telecommunications services.
Since 1993, land-line telephone numbers in New Zealand consist of a single-digit area code and a seven-digit local number, of which the first three digits generally specify the exchange and the final four specify the subscriber's unique line at that exchange.

International number lengths[edit]
The long-distance trunk prefix, 0, which is prepended to national numbers, is not part of the international number.
The minimum number length after the international prefix is three digits. Most numbers, other than service numbers have at least eight digits.
The maximum number length after the international prefix is nine or ten digits (depending on provider).

Present numbering plan[edit]
New Zealand follows an open numbering plan. The country code is 64. The long distance dialing prefix is 0 and the international prefix is 00.

Landlines[edit]
Further information: List of dialling codes in New Zealand
New Zealand landline phone numbers have a total of eight digits, excluding the leading 0: a one-digit area code, and a seven-digit phone number (e.g. 09 700 1234), beginning with a digit between 2 and 9 (but excluding 900, 911, and 999 due to misdial guards).
There are five regional area codes: 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. These must be dialled, along with the domestic trunk prefix, when calling a recipient outside the local calling area of which the caller is located. For example, one calling Dunedin from Christchurch must dial 03, even though Christchurch is 03 as well.
The combined domestic trunk prefix[2] and area codes are:[3]

02 409 for Ross Dependency (Year-round direct dial access to Scott Base & U.S. McMurdo Station - Summer-only access to Zucchelli Station )
03 for the entire South Island and the Chatham Islands
04 for the Wellington metro area and the Kāpiti Coast District (excluding Ōtaki)
06 for Taranaki, Manawatū-Whanganui (excluding Taumarunui and National Park), Hawke's Bay, Gisborne, the Wairarapa and Ōtaki.
07 for the Waikato (excluding Tuakau and Pokeno), Taumarunui and National Park and the Bay of Plenty
09 for Auckland, Northland, Tuakau and Pokeno.
Mobile phones[edit]
Telephone numbers for mobile phones begin with 02, followed by seven to nine digits (usually eight). The first few digits after the 02 indicate the original mobile network that issued the number.
Telephone numbers must always be dialled in full for mobile phones. In the late 1990s however, Telecom mobile phones could dial other Telecom mobile phones without the (then) 025 prefix, making 025 act like a landline area code.

Telecom told existing 025 subscribers that their new number was simply their old number with '0274' in front.[citation needed] While technically correct, it is misleading and has resulted in numbers being incorrectly shown in advertising as "0274 xxx xxx". "0274" is not a valid dialing code.

The introduction of mobile number portability on 1 April 2007 meant that an increasing number of mobiles would be operating on a different network from that which originally assigned the number.
To find out whether a particular number belongs to a specific network provider, one can text the mobile number of interest to 300. It is a free service provided by 2degrees. A reply will be sent to verify whether the number is operating on their network or not. As of September 2019[update], this service will work for Vodafone and Spark Active.

Fictional numbers[edit]
New Zealand has no dedicated series of fictional telephone numbers. Television shows and movies generally use any available range of numbers (e.g. the TVNZ soap opera Shortland Street uses the unassigned (09) 4299 number range.).

Proposed area codes[edit]
In the future (particularly by the 2030s), there are additional proposed area codes of New Zealand separating for most regions except 04 (Wellington), 07 (Waikato) and 09 (Northland, the Bay of Islands and Auckland):

02 (Canterbury Region, Otago and Southland)
03 (Marlborough District, West Coast, Nelson and Tasman District and the Chatham Islands)
05 (Taranaki and Manawatū-Whanganui)
06 (Hawke's Bay, Gisborne, Wairarapa and Ōtaki)
08 (Bay of Plenty)[citation needed]

• +227 ABPQMCDU
The new National Numbering Plan (NNP) of Niger is structured as eight digits, in the following form: ABPQMCDU
In this structure, all the letters may be given values of 0 to 9. The first two digits AB identify the service or the network, while the remaining six digits PQMCDU identify the user unless some other specific meaning has been assigned.
The figure assigned to the letter A indicates the service or network, while the figure assigned to the letter B indicates the operator, the technology or the service.

Nigeria telephone calling codes
Telephone numbers in NigeriaLocationCountryNigeriaContinentAfricaNSN  length8 (landline) or 10 (mobile)Access codesCountry code234International access009Long-distance0, 009
Telephone numbers in Nigeria use an open numbering plan.  They are composed of a combination of an area code and a local line or subscriber telephone number. Area codes consist of one digit (Lagos, Ibadan and Abuja) or two digits. Local telephone numbers contain from five to seven digits, and may vary within the area code. Mobile phone numbers start with 070, 080 or 081, 090 or 091 and are followed by eight digits.


Calling formats[edit]
These examples use calls to Lagos as example:

xxx xxxx – Calls within an area code
01 xxx xxxx – Calls from outside Lagos
+234 1 xxx xxxx – Calls from outside Nigeria
0xxx xxx xxxx  – Calls to a mobile number (see below)
042 xxx xxxx – Landline calls to Enugu.
052****** – Landline calls to Edo.
064 xx xxxx - Landline calls to Kano.
Mobile network prefixes[edit]
The following prefixes are assigned to mobile phone network operators.[1] Nigeria implemented mobile number portability in 2013. Therefore, prefixes no longer reliably indicate the parent network of a number.[2]

Telephone numbers in Norfolk Island use the following dialing codes:

Country code: 672
Area code: 3
International call prefix: 00
Fixed numbers are of the format 672 3 2x xxx.[1]
Mobile numbers are of the format 672 3 5x xxx.[2]
The country code 672 is also used for the Australian Antarctic Territory.[3] The code was also used for Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands, using area codes 2 and 4 respectively.[4] In October 1994, they were migrated to the +61 country code, under area code 091 (using exchange prefixes 62 for Christmas Island and 64 for the Cocos Islands).[5] These numbers have since migrated to the 08 9162 and 08 9164 ranges.[6]
Until 1975, country code 672 was assigned to Portuguese Timor.[7] When that territory was annexed by Indonesia in 1975, it used the Indonesian country code +62 and the area code 390. However, following the end of Indonesian rule in 1999, the code +672 9 was used under an interim arrangement to reach numbers in the territory.[8]

Little is known about phone numbers in the rest of the country, as phone numbers outside Pyongyang and Rason are not able to be dialled from overseas and are hence not advertised in any overseas publications.

International dialing[edit]
Overseas callers to North Korea will usually need to go through the international operator service on +850 2 18111. A select few numbers (mostly fax numbers) are able to be dialled directly, without operator assistance.
Phone numbers in Pyongyang which can call internationally and which can receive calls internationally always begin with 381 in the local number, e.g. +850 2 381 xxxx.[2] These numbers cannot be dialled domestically and cannot make calls domestically, so usually an organisation with international connectivity will have a 381 international number and a 382 domestic number. For example, the British Embassy in Pyongyang can be dialled as +850 2 381 7980 internationally and 02 382 7980 domestically.[3] 381 numbers can, however, call other 381 numbers domestically.[2]
Many North Koreans smuggle in mobile phones from China and use them near the border where they can take advantage of Chinese mobile networks that work there.  The North Korean government has cracked down on illegal phones by deploying surveillance and jamming devices.[4]
Many lines in the Rason Special Economic Zone can also be direct-dialled from outside the country, as many foreign companies (mostly Chinese and Russian) are active in the region.
Calls between North Korea and South Korea are banned,[5] except to or from the Kaesong Industrial Region.

North Macedonia's telephone numbering plan is the system used for assigning telephone numbers in North Macedonia. It is regulated by the Agency for Electronic Communications (AEK), which holds responsibility for telecommunications.
The country calling code of North Macedonia is +389. Area codes should always be dialed, even within the country, because of the many fixed and mobile operators.
An example for calling telephones in Skopje is as follows:

02 xxxxxxx (within Skopje)
02 xxxxxxx (within North Macedonia)
+389 2 xxxxxxx (outside North Macedonia)
Numbering formats for North Macedonia:
+389 2 xxxxxxx  geographic numbers – Skopje 
+389 3x xxxxxx  geographic numbers – eastern area 
+389 4x xxxxxx  geographic numbers – central and western area 
+389 5xx xxxxx  premium, value added, shared revenue 
+389 7x xxxxxx  mobile 
+389 8xx xxxxx  freephone, shared cost
1xx is the general short code format (such as 112 for emergency); 10xx format is for carrier access.
The international call prefix depends on the country you are calling from, e.g. 00 for most European countries, and 011 from America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code.
For calls from North Macedonia, the prefix for international calls is 00 (e.g. for calling a United States number, 00 1 ... should be dialed).

Numbering plan under the former Yugoslavia[edit]
During Yugoslavia's existence, Macedonian area codes all began with 9. On 1 October 1993, North Macedonia was split from the +38 code and the 9 from the area codes was integrated into the country code. Between 2000 and 2001, the 9 in the area codes was generally changed to either 3 or 4. The area codes for Skopje were changed from (091) to (02). In 2003, all Skopje phone numbers were changed from 6 to 7 digits by having an extra digit added to the front of the original number, meaning that (for example) the Yugoslavian number +38 91 123456 became +389 91 123456 in 1993, then +389 2 3123456.[1] When the extra 3 was added to the beginning of Skopje numbers, new 30x and 39x exchanges became available.

Telephone numbers in Northern CyprusLocationCountryNorthern CyprusContinentEuropeAccess codesCountry code+90International access00Long-distance0
In the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), the Turkish numbering plan is in use. Hence the international country code for Northern Cyprus is also +90. 392 is the area code of all landlines. Mobile Operators, Kuzey Kıbrıs Turkcell and KKTC Telsim use 533 and 542 area codes respectively.
For calls from the Republic of Cyprus to Northern Cyprus, the code 0139 followed by the 7-digit subscriber number is used, and are charged at local call rates. 0139 is still used for direct calls to Northern Cyprus, even after the numbering plan change of December 2001.
For calls from Northern Cyprus to the Republic of Cyprus area code 0123 is used, but the call is charged at international rates. It is also possible to use the international prefix 00357.
Direct telephone connections between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus are operated by the United Nations exchange. This allows direct telephone calls between the two communities and has been in place since 4 May 1998.
Since 2 March 2003 direct international calls from Northern Cyprus to Turkey have been possible. Now callers from Cyprus can call Northern Cyprus either through Turkey by dialing 0090 392 xxxxxxx (calls charged at international rates), or by using 0139 (calls charged at local rates).

List of mobile codes[edit]
Note: These are the codes that wireless operators in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus assign to new subscribers. Because of mobile number portability, a subscriber's telephone number may not accurately reflect their actual operator.

Historical numbering plan pre-1993[edit]
Before 1993, telephone numbers would consist either of a two-digit area code and a six-digit subscriber number in cities and large towns, for example, (02) 412702 in Oslo,[1] or a three-digit area code and a five-digit subscriber number in smaller towns, for example, (034) 83000 in Larvik.[2]
On 28 January 1993, a closed telephone numbering plan was adopted, with eight-digit telephone numbers incorporating the area code and full number dialling for local and national calls, with Oslo numbers prefixed with the digits '22'.[3] Service numbers were to be three digits long, Directory numbers four digits and some companies were allocated five-digit numbers, ex. 07575.
GSM telephony was also introduced in 1993, and those numbers always start with the digits '4' or '9'.

Emergency numbers[edit]
Historically, the local operator would take emergency calls and forward them to the police, fire or local doctor. In 1964, the emergency number 000 was introduced. In 1985, a modernized emergency service was started at Haukeland hospital in Bergen for Hordaland. In 1986, the emergency numbers changed to 001 for fire brigade, 002 for police and 003 for ambulance. These numbers changed to 110, 112 and 113 in 1994, when the international access code changed from 095 to 00.

Landline numbers (as of 2020)[edit]
Telephone Geographic numbers were abolished in January 2020, with Telenor finally switching off the country's copper wire network at the end of 2022.[4] Caller IDs will no longer display the region, but rather say "Norway" or be left blank instead. These numbers are today used by VoIP services.

Telephone numbers in PakistanLocation of PakistanLocationCountryPakistanContinentAsiaRegulatorPakistan Telecommunications AuthorityTypeClosedNumbering planNational Numbering Plan PakistanLast updated23 July 2010Access codesCountry code+92International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Pakistan are ten digits long. Landline numbers and mobile numbers have different structures.  Geographically fixed landline are prefixed by an area code which varies in length depending on the significance of the place.  Mobile numbers are prefixed (03) followed by a two-digit code indicating the telephone operator. The international country code for Pakistan is '+92'.


Fixed (landline) numbers[edit]
See also: List of dialling codes in Pakistan
Area codes in Pakistan are from two to five digits long; the smaller the city, the longer the prefix. All the large cities have two-digit codes.
Smaller towns have a six digit number. Azad Jammu and Kashmir has six digit numbers as well. Large cities have seven digit numbers. On 1 July 2009, telephone numbers in Karachi and Lahore were changed from seven digits to eight digits. This was accomplished by adding the digit 9 to the beginning of any phone number that started with a 9 (government and semi-government connexions), and adding the digit 3 to any phone numbers that did not start with the number 9.[1]
It is common to write phone numbers as (0xx) yyyyyyy, where xx is the area code. The 0 prefix is for trunk (long-distance) dialling from within the country. International callers should dial +92xxyyyyyyy
All mobile phone codes are four digits long and start with 03. All mobile numbers are seven digits long, and denote the mobile provider on a nationwide basis and not geographic location.  Thus all Telenor numbers (for example) nationwide carry mobile code 0345 etc.
NWD (area) codes for common cities are:


021 xxxxxxxx: Karachi
022 xxxxxxx: Hyderabad
040 xxxxxxx: Sahiwal
041 xxxxxxxx: Faisalabad

Premium Rate services:*0900 xxxxx
Toll free numbers (for landline callers within Pakistan):*0800 xxxxx

Mobile telephone numbers[edit]
Mobile telephone numbers in Pakistan are of the following format: 03XZ-YYYYYYY where X is the single letter code assigned to a specific mobile telephone operator and Z-YYYYYYY is the local telephone number from any mobile phone or landline.

3 - is the Mobile Access code
Z can be any value between 0 and 9, assigned by the operator itself, except in case of SCOM where Z=5 only
X=0 Jazz
X=1 Zong
X=2 Jazz
X=3 Ufone
X=4 Telenor Pakistan
X=5 SCO (Z = 5 only)
X=6 Instaphone (defunct)

355 - SCO
364 - Instaphone (defunct)
370 - Zong
International callers must dial +92-3XZ-YYYYYYY to reach a mobile number in Pakistan from outside Pakistan, where '+92' is the Country Code, '3XZ' is Mobile Access Code as per the above list and 'YYYYYYY' is personal number.
Within Pakistan the same number can be reached by dialing either 03XZ-YYYYYYY or '0092-3XZ-YYYYYYY' or '+92-3XZ-YYYYYYY' from any mobile device or landline.
In order to dial a landline number from a mobile phone in Pakistan, city code is required in all cases. However, city code is not required between landline calls within the same city. For instance, to call a landline number 'YYYYYYY' from another landline in the same city, dial only 'YYYYYYY'.

All telephone numbers in Panama are seven or eight digits long (xxx-xxxx or 6xxx-xxxx) and there are no area codes.[1] All numbers that both begin with 6 and have 8 digits are mobile numbers. All landline numbers have 7 digits. The first digit of landline numbers may be used to vaguely identify the location of the caller. Mobile phones were also assigned 7 digit numbers until 2005, when they were moved to their own number space with 8 digits. Mobile numbers are recycled if the user is marked as inactive by the mobile service provider, and landline numbers are also recycled if a user cancels their landline phone service.

Telephone numbers in ParaguayLocationCountryParaguayContinentSouth AmericaAccess codesCountry code+595International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Paraguay all have the same format since 2002, consisting of the country code (595), followed by a phone number.
Phone numbers in Paraguay have 9 digits. The first two or three digits are the area code, the remaining six or seven digits are the subscriber number.
According to ITU document for Paraguay,[1] the national number format for the basic telephony service may have 2 variations:


National number


Area code
Subscriber number


A  B
X  Y  Z  M  C  D  U


A  B  E
X  Y  M  C  D  U

Where A is NOT equal to 0, 1, 8 and 9; and B, X and Y is NOT equal to 0.
To make local calls inside Paraguay, the 6- or 7-digit subscriber number is used.
To make a call to cell phone, dial "0" + the number of cell phone.
To make inter-provincial calls, it is required to dial prefix "0" followed by (P)QR code + the 9-digit phone number.
(P)QR is the code for long-distance basic service providers which have the following format: (P)[2-7][1-8]. Presently(?), digit "P" is reserved. Thus, only 2 digits "QR" are used presently.
To make an international call, it is required to dial prefix "00" followed by (P)QR code + the international number.
Numbers starting with the digit "1" are used for special services like Ambulance - 128.

Mobile phone calls within Peru (Mobile Virtual Area)[edit]
From September 4, 2010, a national Mobile Virtual Area[2]  was created meaning that all mobile numbers in Peru are non-geographical (not attached to any geographical region but instead to the new MVA). In addition to that all mobile numbers across the country turned to nine digits long: 9xx xxx xxx.[3]
The following instructions are valid across the country:[4]

Calls from mobile to mobile[edit]
    9xx xxx xxx (just dial the 9-digit number)

Calls from mobile to landline[edit]
    0 + area code + phone number
    Example on how to call to Piura: 0 + 73 + xxxxxx

Calls from fixed line to mobile[edit]
    9xx xxx xxx (just dial the 9-digit number)

Domestic calls within Peru[edit]
Calls from fixed line to landline[edit]
    Call to a number in the same area: just dial the phone number

    Call to a number in another area (domestic long distance):  0 + area code + phone number.

International long distance[edit]
Calling Peru from abroad[edit]
Calling a fixed line[edit]
    +51 + area code + phone number

Where the plus sign (+) represents the international access code of the country you are calling from.
From North America: 011 + 51 + area code + phone number
Example: 

Calling a fixed line in Lima:  011 51 1  1234567
Calling a fixed line in Cusco: 011 51 84  123456
Calling a fixed line in Machu Picchu: 011 51 84  123456
From Europe or most APAC countries: 00 + 51 + area code + phone number

Calling a mobile number[edit]
In Peru, a cell-phone number starts with a 9.

    +51 9XX XXX XXX (9-digit mobile number)

The mobile virtual area eliminates the use of area code for mobile numbers.

Calling abroad from Peru[edit]
In Peru, when making an international call you may choose a carrier for international calls different from your usual carrier/provider according to the rates carriers offer to attract callers. This system is known as "call by call" (in Spanish "Llamada por llamada") as each call can be made with a different carrier and is available to both fixed lines and mobile phones. Each carrier uses a 4-digit prefix (format 19XX).

International dialing format[edit]
This is the standard format in Peru for making calls abroad from fixed lines and mobile phones:

    19XX + 00 + country code + area code + phone number

Carriers:

Americatel: 1977[5]
Claro: 1912[6]
IDT: 1914[7]
Convergia: 1960
Movistar: 1911[8]
Entel: 1990 (valid only for Entel customers)
Bitel: 1968
It is mandatory to choose a 19XX carrier when calling internationally from a fixed line.
If you are calling internationally from a mobile phone you have the option not to use the 19XX prefix. You may dial starting with the "+" symbol

    +country code + area code + phone number

and the international call will go through your provider's network.

Example calls[edit]
From Peru to USA/Canada:

From fixed line or mobile phone: 19XX + 00 + 1 + area code + phone number
From mobile phone (2° alternative): +1 + area code + phone number (your call will go through your usual provider's network)
Special numbers[edit]
103 is the telephone information number
105 is the Police Emergency Number
106 is the Ambulance number
116 is the Fire number
911 is the Emergency Services number

Telephone numbers in PortugalLocation of Portugal (dark green)LocationCountryPortugalContinentEuropeTypeClosedNSN  length9Access codesCountry code+351International access00Long-distancenone

Portugal changed to a closed telephone numbering plan on 31 October 1999; previously, the trunk prefix was '0', but this was dropped.[1]
For landline subscribers, the area code, prefixed by the digit '2', was incorporated into the subscriber's number. For mobile subscribers, formerly seven (to call another subscriber using the same operator) or eleven (to call any mobile subscriber) digits were used.[1] For special number ranges, formerly ten digits were used, but the initial '0' was dropped.[1] These changes made that nine digits were used for all calls after 1999.[1]
Before 1999 Portugal Telecom controlled Portugal's entire landline telephone network.[2] On 16 December 1999 Anacom announced that the market would be opened to competitors on 1 January 2000.[2]


Geographic numbering[edit]
Numbering examples for Lisbon area:[1]

         xxx xxxx  (before 1999, within Lisbon)
      01 xxx xxxx  (before 1999, within Portugal, including Lisbon)
 +351  1 xxx xxxx  (before 1999, outside Portugal)
      2x xxx xxxx  (after 1999, within Portugal, including Lisbon)
      2x(x) xxx xxx  (present day, within Portugal, including Lisbon)
 +351 21 xxx xxxx  (after 1999, outside Portugal)
 +351 2x(x) xxx xxx  (present day, outside Portugal)

Mobile telephone numbering[edit]
Mobiles similarly changed, with the digits 9T replacing the prefix 093T, where T is a digit specific to a mobile operator, that can be 1 (Telecel, now Vodafone Portugal), 0, 2 or 6 (TMN/MEO) or 3 (Optimus/NOS):

          xxx xxxx  (before 1999 for Portuguese subscribers using the same mobile operator)
     093T xxx xxxx  (before 1999 within Portugal, T=1,3,6)
 +351 93T xxx xxxx  (before 1999 outside Portugal, T=1,3,6) 
       9T xxx xxxx  (after 1999 within Portugal, T=1,3,6,2)
 +351  9T xxx xxxx  (after 1999 outside Portugal, T=1,2,3,6)
 +351  9Tx xxx xxx  (present day outside Portugal, T=1,3,6,2,0)

Other numbering[edit]
New number ranges include:[3]

Telephone numbers in Puerto Rico are assigned under the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). Their area codes are 787 or 939.
Prior to March 1, 1996, Puerto Rico was one of many Caribbean islands served by area code 809.  On that date Puerto Rico was assigned the new area code 787 (with the mnemonic PUR or PTR).  Permissive dialing of 809 ended January 31, 1997.
Within only four years, 787 was already on the brink of exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones and dial-up Internet connections. To solve the problem, 787 was overlaid with area code 939 in or about September 2001, with ten-digit dialing required for all calls. A split had been ruled out in order to spare Puerto Ricans the expense and burden of changing their numbers for the second time in a decade, the island's extremely dense population, and the lack of a suitable boundary for a split. 939 is primarily used for cell phones.

Telephone numbers in RomaniaLocation of Romania (dark green)LocationCountryRomaniaContinentEuropeAccess codesCountry code+40International access00Long-distance0
The dialling plan for mobile networks (numbers starting with 07) and new landline operators (numbers starting with 03) is closed; all subscriber numbers must be dialled in full. For landline numbers starting with 02, the dialling plan used to be open; the trunk digit and area code could be omitted if the caller was in the same area code as the callee. However, starting May 3, 2008, all landline numbers must be dialled in full.[1]


History[edit]
Landlines[edit]
Prior to 1990, there was no direct international access. Numbers had 5 digits except for Bucharest, where numbers were 6 digits long. Area code started with 9 and were 2 digits long for Bucharest (90-xxx-xxx) and 3 digits long (9pp-xx-xxx) for the rest of the country. The Bucharest surrounding area had the area code 909, followed by 5 digits number.
Somewhere in the end of the 80s, some big cities' area codes were upgraded, including the last digit of the area code into the local number, thus making it 6-digits long. However, calling between non-local areas always required dialling the area code, even when the called party's  code was the same as the caller's. For example, a number from Iași was 981-xx-xxx, then it became 98-1xx-xxx. A number from Suceava was 982-xx-xxx, but then it became 98-2xx-xxx. Apart from Bucharest, Brașov was the first city to have 6-digit numbers.
Many smaller town or rural area calling implied using manual commutation circuits operated by humans.
Short numbers for special services, like cab companies, were three digits long, starting with 0:

00 used for checking the phone line.
01, later 011 local exchange operator (free number)
02, later 021 telephone line service (possibly telephone service, if bought or rented from the telephone company)
023 elevators service (only in Bucharest)
03, later 031 telephone directory
05, later 051 informations
055 police (unknown implementation on 2-digit codes)
058 exact time (every 10 seconds)
059 weather forecast (recorded message)
06, later 061 ambulance (free number)
07, later 071 international calls via operator
08, later 081 fire brigade (free number)
09, later 091 domestic calls via operator (reverse charge or calls to manual commutation lines)
After 1989, the then-monopolistic state-owned phone company started a process of upgrading its facilities. In 1992, it started increasing the size of a number to 7 digits in Bucharest and 6 digits in the rest of the country and by changing the prefixing scheme. The long distance code was changed from 9 to 0, the area code for Bucharest became 01, while to the rest of the country was temporarily given a 0 before the older area codes. For a short period, the surrounding of Bucharest (now Ilfov county) had the area code 0179, which has been eventually included into the Bucharest numbering plan as 01-79x-xxxx. The 02 code was used for calls to the Republic of Moldova.
In 1993, the other counties were given new area codes (30 to 69). The previous area code system did not follow the country administrative regions. Outside county dialing required a national access code 0 (01-xxx-xxxx to Bucharest and 0pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country). In-county calling could be done without prefixes at all (xxx-xxxx to Bucharest and xxx-xxx for the rest of the country). Calling from outside meant +40-1-xxx-xxxx for Bucharest and +40-pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country. An international access code for calling abroad, 00, was adopted. County codes were selected on a geographical order, starting with northern Moldavia (Suceava County had 30), then going southwards to eastern Wallachia, than westwards to Banat, then northern Transylvania and it ends in the southern Transylvania, until the highest prefix, 69 (used for Sibiu County). The short numbers for special services started with 9 and were three digits long. Each town or county has its own special services, callable with the same number throughout the country.

Mobile numbers[edit]
The first mobile company was Telemobil (an ancestor of Zapp) and it started its service in 1993 using the analogue NMT technology. The numbers for this network were using the prefix 018-5xx-xxx and 018-6xx-xxx. As 01 was the area code for Bucharest, the mobile numbers had to be dialed with the prefix included, even from Bucharest.
Somewhere around 1998, Telemobil changed its technology to Low Emission Mobile System (LEMS) and operated under the brand name SunTel. The service has proven ineffective and has been changed to the current technology used under the name Zapp Mobile. Since SunTel, the prefix has been changed from 018 to 098 (now 0788).
In 1996, the first GSM phone companies, Connex and Dialog, were allotted from the remaining prefixes, which were county-like, 2 digits, prefixes. In the beginning, Connex got the prefix 92 and Dialog got 94. Calling a Connex mobile from any phone in the country was 0-92-xxx-xxx. Afterwards, Connex also got 91 and 93 area codes, Dialog got 95 and 90, the newly founded Zapp Mobile got 98, and Cosmorom 96. Short numbers were now allowed in both the older form and in 4 digits long forms, both with a leading 9.

Toll-free and premium rate[edit]
At the same time, no-charge numbers were allocated to special prefixes or to the Bucharest area code, looking like 01800-xxxx . Under a special agreement, even before this reform, foreign operators could be reached at various numbers, usually in the prefix 800 (AT&T used 01800-1800). The extra-charge numbers were allotted the prefix 0189, being called like 0189-xxx-xxx. This has been extended to all area codes, as 0pp-89x-xxx, and callers could dial them without the area codes, like the regular local calls. This made them too accessible to children and sometimes telephone lines were hijacked to make calls to these services, then to be charged to the line subscribers who never made these calls by themselves. It was very customary to the aggressive advertising to write the costs of the services with small fonts, likely unreadable on the TV screen, then announcing the first 20 seconds free, writing the "free" word in bigger size, to induce the idea of the calls being all free.
One of the most popular premium rate numbering class was (01)8989-xxx, mostly used for media services and TV games. Therefore, the premium rate numbers were mostly known as "8989".
The internet dial-up services used similar numbers, like (01)893-xxxx and (0pp)890-xxx or (0pp)893-xxxx. Some premium-rate internet dial-up services used (01)899-xxxx. However, these services were charged at most twice or three times a local call, unless called from a different area.
For a short time before the current numbering plan, two prefixes were implemented for toll-free numbers (080-xxx-xxx) and premium rate numbers (089-xxx-xxx). However, until the implementation of the current numbering plan, all the 018xx and 0xx89 numbers remained unchanged. A special call barring service has been introduced to prevent fraudulent calls to premium rate services. Even today there still are local numbers starting with 89, but only for internet dial-up, and they are migrating to the new prefix 0870.
Usually mobile phone users and abroad callers could not and cannot access no-charge or extra-charge numbers. Extra-charge SMS were sent to three digits numbers, each company having its own system.

Later years[edit]
In the last years, landline usage started to drop within Romania, as the mobile phones market was growing fast[when?]. Mobile phone companies were running out of numbers, as both the main mobile companies claimed millions upon millions of subscribers. Also, as the imminent accession to the EU was going to cause the state-owned company to lose its landline monopoly, a reform was introduced in 2002. This  modified the system to a 10 digits system, of which the first is always a national access code 0. The first 4 digits, including the leading 0, give the area code, in the format 0ZYX, where X, Y are digits from 0 to 9 and Z is a digit from 2 to 9. The geographic area codes for Bucharest are 0Z1, with a digit less than all the other area codes and an extra digit to the local number. For example, the Romtelecom area code for Bucharest is 021-xxx-xxxx, and for Neamț County is 0233-xxx-xxx.
The Z digit gives the type of the area code:

Z=2 and 3 means a landline number; the YX code is 1 (with extra digit for local number) for Bucharest, from 30 to 69 for a county code, and 70 to 79 for non-geographic landline numbers;
Z=7 (and possibly 6 in the future) means a mobile number; 070p-xxxxxx  numbers are reserved for virtual operators, while 071p-xxxxxx to 079p-xxxxxx are reserved for certain mobile company code
Z=8 means either a toll-free (0800-xxxxxx), shared cost, personal numbering, virtual cards, pre-paid cards, or internet dial-up numbers
Z=9 means a premium-rate number, like 0900-xxx-xxx; business and financial information and service use 0903-xxx-xxx and adult entertainment use 0906-xxx-xxx
Most new landline companies, like UPC Romania (formerly Astral) or Romania Data Systems (RDS), were granted new area codes with Z=3, e.g. 031-xxx-xxxx for Bucharest, and 03pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country. Because these area codes are shared between more companies, the entire number must be dialed, even within the same network.
The numbers with Z=2, e.g. 021-xxx-xxxx or 02pp-xxx-xxx, belong almost exclusively to Telekom Romania (formerly called Romtelecom). However, smaller companies were granted numbers with these area codes, like 021-59x-xxxx, and the local numbers are assigned in descending order of the first 3 digits, like (599xxxx, 598xxxx, ..., or 529xxxx, 528xxxx, ...). In Bucharest, local numbers starting with 5 were not used by Romtelecom, hence the usage of this digit. For other counties, if 5 had not been used by Romtelecom, it is preferred for the first digit of numbers of other companies. There are few companies requesting numbering resources with Z=2, and in most cases the companies provide local service only and do not extend their network in the whole country.
Formerly within Romtelecom, local numbers were always dialed without area codes, but other numbers were always to be dialed with the area codes, even if it was the same one. However this was changed beginning with May 3, 2008: from that date Romtelecom subscribers can dial full 10 digit numbers for local calls, and since August 1, 2008 they are required to dial the full 10 digit number.
The mobile companies use prefixes starting with 7: 71 for Romtelecom, 72 and 73 for Vodafone Romania (previously branded as Connex), 74 and 75 for Orange Romania (previously branded as Dialog), 76 for Telekom Romania Mobile (previously branded as Cosmote), 77 for RCS&RDS, 78 for Zapp Mobile, etc.
The first Romanian MVNO is Enigma System ([1]), which was granted a block of 100000 numbers in the 070 block (like 07000-xxxxx), on 27 September 2011.[2]
Free phone numbers start with 800 (like 0-800-xxx-xxx). Strangely, some companies to whom a numbering class is allocated may not grant toll-free access to those numbers for other networks. Therefore, sometimes a "toll-free" number is advertised as "toll free only within some operator".
Some 08pp prefixes are used for various services, like:

0801 for shared-cost numbers
0802 for personal numbering
0806 for virtual cards
0807 for pre-paid cards
087p for Internet dial-up; for the moment, only 0870 is used
Extra-charge numbers start with 90p, with some service types with their own prefixes, like business and financial information (0903) and adult entertainment (0906). There are few used prefixes in the 09pp range, the rest of them are stated as reserved, unlike for the 08pp range, which holds more service types, either toll-free or not.
The former extra-charge numbers were starting with 021-89-xxxxx for Bucharest and 02pp-89x-xxx for the other regions, thus being a subset of the numbers owned by Romtelecom. Currently these numbers are sometimes used for premium rate or normal Internet dial-up services. The usage of these numbers for such services is however discouraged, as the new prefix for Internet dial-up is 0870. There are some dial-up services using these numbers, and most of them begin with (021- or 02pp-)893 or 899.
Calling from Romania to Romania usually implies using the full 10 digits number. Romtelecom county codes were chosen on a geographical order, starting with northern Moldavia (Suceava County had 30), then going southwards to eastern Wallachia, than westwards to southern Transylvania, than northwards, closing the circle with the highest prefix, 69 (used for Sibiu County). These county codes were extended to all landline area codes.
Extra-charge SMS are sent to three or four digits numbers, each company having its own system.
Short numbers are allowed in both the 3 digits and in 4 digits forms, with a leading 9, like 981 for the fire brigade, 961 for ambulance, 955 for police or 9xxx for various companies, including taxi, medical services, guards, information and others. Each town or county has its own special services, like firefighters, police, with the same number. The station to which these calls are directed is chosen based on location. Unlike for Bucharest, other regions use short numbers with 3 digits only, including the leading 9. These services are provided by Romtelecom, therefore the area code must be dialed before the number when calling from other network.
The short local numbers which are the same in the whole country are:

02YX-922 Romtelecom devices service (for phones and other equipment bought or rented from Romtelecom), 021-9222 for Bucharest
02YX-925 Romtelecom GBM sales and customer support, 021-9255 for Bucharest
02YX-923 or 02YX-926 elevator service, 021-923(x) or 021-926(x) for more companies in Bucharest
02YX-928 former local gas company; new companies use other numbers; in Bucharest 021-928x for more gas companies
02YX-929 electricity company; 021-9291 for Bucharest and 021-9292 for surrounding area
02YX-953 former state-owned taxi company; the privatised company still holds this number, 021-9531 for Bucharest
02YX-954 former state-owned freight taxi company; the privatised company still holds this number, 021-9541 for Bucharest
02YX-955 police, 021-9555 for Bucharest; no longer toll-free since the implementation of 112
02YX-956 gendarmerie, 021-9566 for Bucharest; formerly a taxi company number in Bucharest
02YX-959 Border police, 021-9590 for Bucharest; (probably on counties along the country border or holding international airports)
02YX-961 state-owned ambulance and medical service 021-9611 for Bucharest; allegedly no longer toll-free since the implementation of 112
971 international calls via operator (this Romtelecom service is an exception and keeps the original short format even after August 1, 2008)
02YX-981 fire brigade, 021-9811 for Bucharest; allegedly no longer toll-free since the implementation of 112
991 domestic calls via operator, for reverse charge calls (this Romtelecom service is another exception and keeps the original short format even after August 1, 2008)
Some short numbers are used for network services, for rotary telephones which cannot dial * and #.
Romania joined the European initiative for a continent-wide emergency number, 112. With the implementation of this service, the former emergency numbers are no longer toll-free, unless they are redirected to 112.
Number portability is planned to be available after October 21, 2008.
Besides the 112 service, and the reserved 11x numbers, a number may not begin with 1. There are some special codes which start with 1:

10xx carrier selection, with intermediate tone
16xx carrier selection, followed by number
19x(...) nationwide short numbers (implemented since May 2, 2008)
1921 Romtelecom phone line service
1930 Romtelecom sales and customer support
118932 Romtelecom directory information
1932 Romtelecom directory information in Hungarian language
1951 Various information service
1957 telegrams
1958 current time announcement (every 10 seconds)
When calling from abroad, the leading zero is dropped and replaced with the international access code and the country code, like +40-xxx-xxx-xxx. Only regular landline and mobile phones are accessible from outside Romania.
When calling abroad from Romania, the international access code is 00. From mobile devices the + is also supported, as per the GSM system standard.

In the island of Saint Helena and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha, telecommunications are administered by Sure Saint Helena. There is a fixed five-digit number plan, and the country calling code is +290.
Ascension Island is also part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, but it has a separate calling code and numbering scheme.


2013 change to numbering plan[edit]
From 1 October 2013, all existing 4-digit telephone numbers on St Helena were to be prefixed by a '2' to move from a 4-digit to a 5-digit numbering plan.[1] The change in numbering resulted from an increased demand for new telephone services and also provided a platform for the future introduction of a cellular network on the island.[2]

Telephone numbers in San MarinoLocationCountrySan MarinoContinentEuropeAccess codesCountry code378International access00Long-distancenone
Telephone numbers in San Marino have six to ten digits. Numbers starting with either 0, 8 or 9 are assigned to landlines, 6 is used for mobile services, 5 for IP telephony services and 7 for premium numbers. No trunk prefixes are used: all the digits are always dialed.[1]
The country code for San Marino is 378.[2] However, landlines are also reachable via the Italian country code 39.[3]
The international call prefix is 00. The emergency numbers are 112/113 (police), 115 (fire) and 118 (ambulance).[4]


History[edit]
Until 1996, San Marino was part of the Italian telephone numbering plan, using the Italian area code 0549.[5] In 1996, the country adopted country code 378, although existing dialing arrangements between San Marino and Italy continued without change.[6] In 1998, as Italy switched to a closed dialing plan, San Marino incorporated the 0549 area code into its subscriber numbers.[7]
A telephone number in San Marino may be reached as follows:[citation needed]

0549 xxx xxx: from Italy
+378 xxx xxx: from all other countries
+39 0549 xxx xxx: from other countries, using the Italian country code
+378 0549 xxx xxx: from other countries, using the San Marino country code and the Italian area code
Previously, country code 295 had been allocated to San Marino by the International Telecommunication Union in the late 1980s.[8]

Regulation of the telephone numbers in Serbia is under the responsibility of the Regulatory Agency of Electronic Communication and Mail Services (RATEL), independent regulatory authority.[1]  The country calling code of Serbia is +381. The country has an open telephone numbering plan, with most numbers consisting of a 2- or 3-digit calling code and a 6-7 digits of customer number.


Overview[edit]
The country calling code of Serbia is +381. Serbia and Montenegro received the code of +381 following the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992 (which had +38 as country code). Montenegro switched to +382 after its independence in 2006, so +381 is now used only by Serbia.[2]
An example for calling telephones in Belgrade, Serbia is as follows:

xxx xx xx (within Belgrade)
011 xxx xx xx (within Serbia)
+381 11 xxx xx xx (outside Serbia)
The international call prefix depends on the country being called from: for example, 00 for most European countries and 011 from North America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code.
For calls from Serbia, the prefix for international calls was 99, but was changed to 00 since 1 April 2008, in order to match the majority of Europe[3] (e.g. for a United States number 00 1 ... should be dialed).

Landline telephony[edit]
Calling code areas in Serbia have been largely unchanged since the time of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As Socialist Republic of Serbia had been assigned codes starting with 1, 2 and 3, they were simply carried over by Serbia after the breakup.

Until 2013, Telekom Srbija had a monopoly on fixed telephony services. When the new regulation came in force, competition became allowed in this field as well, and other operators entered the market, using alternative communication infrastructure:

Orion Telekom –  over CDMA
SBB – over coaxial cable (cable TV infrastructure)
Yettel Serbia –  offering services only to business customers
Mobile telephony[edit]
There are three active mobile operators in Serbia (without Kosovo):

Mobile Telephony of Serbia, styled as mts – subsidiary of Telekom Srbija
Yettel Serbia
A1 Serbia
and three virtual mobile operators:

SBB
Globaltel
Vectone Mobile
The calling codes are assigned to the operators using the following scheme:

62, 63, 69

Yettel Serbia


64, 65, 66

mts


677

Globaltel (MVNO)


678

Vectone Mobile (MVNO)

Calling codes in the table are assigned to new customers by the respective provider. However, since 2011 customers can change the operator and retain the old calling code (along with the rest of the phone number). Thus, calling codes do not necessarily reflect the operator. It is not possible, however, to transfer a mobile number to a land-based operator and vice versa.

In 2012, 2-digit emergency numbers were replaced by 3-digit ones (i.e. 192, 193 and 194 instead of 92, 93 and 94). This also applied to 976 (becoming 1976), 985 (becoming  1985), 987 (becoming 1987) and 9860 (becoming 19 860).[4] 112 redirects to 192 on mobile phones.[5]

Kosovo[edit]
Main article: Telephone numbers in Kosovo
The dialing code for Kosovo is +383. This code is the property of Serbia which it received by ITU through Serbia for the needs of the geographical region Kosovo as a result of the 2013 Brussels Agreement signed by the governments of Serbia and Kosovo.[6][7] Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but retained the +381 calling code only for fixed telephony until 2016. Dialing code +383 started to be allocated on 15 December 2016.[8][9]
Currently phone numbers are accessible through both +381 and +383 codes.

Telephone numbers in SingaporeLocation of SingaporeLocationCountrySingaporeContinentAsiaRegulatorInfo-communications Media Development AuthorityTypeClosedNSN  length8Format+65 XXXX XXXXAccess codesCountry code+65International access000, 001, 002, 008, 011, 013, 018, 019, 020, and 021Long-distancenone (Previously 0 via Malaysia until 1995)
Telephone numbers in Singapore, also known as the National Numbering Plan, are regulated by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Due to the small geographical size of Singapore, there are no area or trunk codes; all numbers belong to one numbering area, and thus come in the same 8-digit format. Numbers are categorised based on the first digit, thus providing ten possible categories, of which six are currently in use and the remaining four reserved for future usage.


History[edit]
Until 1985, subscribers' telephone numbers in Singapore were five and six digits. Five digits were introduced in 1960s, whereas 5-digit and 6-digit phone numbers were introduced in 1960s as fixed lines grew, but in that year, these changed to seven digits as the introduction of new towns arose (Tampines, Jurong East, Bukit Batok, Yishun and Hougang) and a large number of new numbers were required. Rationalisation was based on geographical locale over the 12 years.
On 1 September 1995, the digit '9' was added to the front of mobile and pager numbers, making numbers eight digits, and on 1 March 2002, the digit '6' was added to the front of existing fixed line telephone numbers. The migration to the 8-digit numbering plan was planned to be on 2002, ahead of 2004 deadline. Full telecommunication liberalisation in April 2000 led to rapid growth in the market, resulting in increased demand in numbers. The implementation of 8-digit numbering plan, ensured that there would be a sufficient number resource pool to cater to the expanded telecommunication services. Preparation work started in 1999, as an effective approach had to be worked out for the implementation, with minimum service disruption and inconvenience to customers. The public telecommunication service providers - SingTel and StarHub, implemented the 8-digit numbering plan and ensure smooth service continuity for their customers after the migration. There was a parallel run of 7-digit and 8-digit numbers from 1 March 2002 to 31 March 2002. From 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002, those calling the 7-digit numbers would hear the number change announced, prompting them to add the digit "6" to the old number, after which the call would be disconnected. After 30 June, callers would hear the announcement that the number was unavailable.
In March 2004, in response to the growing mobile phone numbering in Singapore, 8-digit mobile phone numbers starting with the digit "8" were introduced.
In 2005, Infocomm Development Authority, the regulating authority at that time, introduced a policy framework which would govern IP telephony services, while introducing 8-digit phone numbers starting with the digit '3' for such services at the same time.[1][2]

Calls to Malaysia and Indonesian border towns[edit]
Until 1995, calls to Malaysia from Singapore were direct and similar to domestic phone calls, with only the area code for fixed line or Malaysian mobile phone code and number being required, hence 03 for Kuala Lumpur fixed line or 019 for Celcom mobile carrier were dialed instead of +60 3 and +60 19. In 1995, owing to the divergence of the two countries' numbering plans, the Subscriber Trunk Dialling prefix 020 was adopted.[3] For example, in order to call a number in Kuala Lumpur, 020 is dialled first, followed by the area code 3 (excluding the leading zero), then the subscriber number.[4]
Similarly, calls to Batam, Samarinda, Pekanbaru and Tanjung Pinang in Indonesia require only the code 011, followed by the area code (minus '0') and the subscriber's number, hence to call a number in Batam from Singapore, a subscriber would dial 011 778 xxx xxx, instead of the international code +62 778. Calls to the rest of Indonesia, including those to mobile phones, require international dialling.
Following the liberalization of the telecommunications industry, new carriers are assigned new carrier-specific codes for international and regional trunk call services. The codes 020 and 011 are assigned to the incumbent carrier SingTel. The other two major carriers, M1 and StarHub, do not offer any special dialling arrangements for calling to Malaysia and Indonesia, instead requiring full international dialling, the same as calling other countries.

International direct dialing[edit]
The generic international call prefix when making an international call is 000, which all telecommunications service providers are required to share. However, the code is not well known as carrier-specific access codes are generally used, such as 001 for SingTel, 002 for M1 and 008 for StarHub. On a mobile phone, a plus sign (+) can be keyed in as a substitute for the prefix.

VoIP services[edit]
VoIP services, such as Zone 1511, use prefixes in the 15xx range. For example, to call a number in London using Zone 1511, a subscriber would dial 1511 44 20 xxxx xxxx. Access codes in the 0xx range (for example, 018 - StarHub's VoIP services or 019 - SingTel's VoIP services) indicate a Tier 1 VoIP provider. Access codes like 1xxx (for example, 1511) are indicative of a Tier 2 VoIP provider.

This page details the format and usage of telephone numbers in Slovakia. Today, Slovakia uses a closed numbering plan with area codes beginning with 0. After 0, there is usually a 2-digit prefix, followed by a 7-digit subscriber number. The capital, Bratislava, has one-digit prefix and an 8-digit subscriber number.
Following the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the successor states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, continued to share the 42 country code, until 28 February 1997, when the Czech Republic adopted 420 while Slovakia adopted 421.[1]

Telephone numbers in SloveniaLocationCountrySloveniaContinentEuropeAccess codesCountry code+386International access00Long-distance0
Slovenia received a new country code following the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991 (which previously had +38 as country code). Additionally, the Ipko mobile phone company in Kosovo used the +386 country code.


Number length[edit]
All telephone numbers are 9 digits long (initial 0 plus eight numbers). The first one, two, or three digits after the zero are the area code. The possible formats are: (0x) xxx xx xx, (0xx) xxx xxx, and (0xxx) xx xxx.
Originally, there was only one provider of landline telephony, Telekom Slovenije.
When making a call within the same landline area (Telekom), the area code is omitted. If a number has been transferred to another operator (e.g. T-2), it can still be reached without the area code; but to call from a transferred number, the area code must be dialed in all cases. Examples:

01 xxx xx xx (Telekom) to 01 xxx xx xx (Telekom) dials xxx xx xx
01 xxx xx xx (Telekom) to 01 xxx xx xx (T-2) dials xxx xx xx
01 xxx xx xx (T-2) to 01 xxx xx xx (Telekom or T-2) dials 01 xxx xx xx.
This does not apply for mobile phone numbers and VoIP numbers, where the area code must always be dialed.

Example for calling[edit]
The international call prefix depends on the country you are calling from; e.g., 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code. The prefix for international calls from Slovenia is 00 (e.g., for a United States number 00 1 ... should be dialled).
An example for calling telephones in Ljubljana is as follows:

xxx xx xx (within Ljubljana)
01 xxx xx xx (within Slovenia)
+386 1 xxx xx xx (outside Slovenia)

1Prior to 2000, the area codes were as follows: Ljubljana – 061, Trbovlje – 0601, Maribor – 062, Ravne na Koroškem – 0602, Celje – 063, Kranj – 064, Nova Gorica – 065, Koper – 066, Postojna – 067, Novo Mesto – 068, Krško – 0608, Murska Sobota – 069.
2 Calling codes in the table are assigned to new customers by the respective provider. However, it has been possible to change the operator and retain the old calling code (along with the rest of the phone number) since 2006. Calling codes do not necessary reflect the operator, but it is not possible to transfer a mobile number to a land-based operator and vice versa.
3 Until 31 December 1997,[2] the emergency numbers were: Police – 92, Fire brigade – 93, Ambulance – 94, Civil protection – 985.

Before the civil war in 1991, very few people had access to the government-controlled fixed-line telephony that only operated in a few areas. Following the fall of the central government, the telecommunication industry fell into the hands of private investors and telephone numbering remained unregulated.[1] Following its re-establishment in 2012,[2] the Federal Government the government recognized the need to establish regulatory frameworks to ensure effective oversight and development of the telecommunication sector, and in 2017, the government enacted the National Communications Authority which is tasked to regulate and oversee the telecommunications industry. 



Calling formats[edit]
To call Somalia, the following format is used:

yxx xxx xxx, yyx xxx xxx or yyy xxx xxx - clls within Somalia.
+252 yxx xxx xxx, +252 yyx xxx xxx or +252 yyy xxx xxx  - calls from outside Somalia.
List of area codes in Somalia[edit]
The telecommunication industry in Somalia has been managed by private businesses since the collapse of the Siad Barre government in 1991.[3] However, following the establishment of the National Communications Authority] in 2017, the regulation of the country's telecom industry is now overseen by this authority, who has developed a number of regulations since its establishment.
In 2021, the National Communications Authority standardized the numbering of the fixed telephone services and has allocated codes to the Federal Member States in the following format:[4]

South Africa telephone calling codes


Telephone numbers in South AfricaLocation of South Africa (dark green)LocationCountrySouth AfricaContinentAfricaRegulatorIndependent Communications Authority of South AfricaTypeClosedNSN  length9Format(AB) xxx-xxxxNumbering planNumbering Plan RegulationsLast updatedMarch 24, 2016Access codesCountry code+27International access00Long-distance0
South Africa switched to a closed numbering system effective 16 January 2007. At that time, it became mandatory to dial the full 10-digit telephone number, including the zero in the three-digit area code, for local calls (e.g., 011 must be dialed from within Johannesburg). Area codes within the system are generally organized geographically. All telephone numbers are 9 digits long (but always prefixed by 0 for calls within South Africa), except for certain Telkom special services. When dialed from another country, the "0" is omitted and replaced with the appropriate international access code and the country code +27.


Background[edit]
History[edit]
Numbers were allocated when South Africa had only four provinces, meaning that ranges are now split across the current nine provinces.
South-West Africa (including Walvis Bay) was integrated into the South African numbering plan.[1] However, the territory had already been allocated its own country code by the International Telecommunication Union, +264, in the late 1960s.[2]

Namibia[edit]
Following its independence, Namibia discontinued direct dialing from South Africa and replaced it with international dialing using the +264 country code. For example, for a call from South Africa to Windhoek, before and after 1992:

Before 1992: 061 xxx xxxx
After 1992: 09 26461 xxx xxxx[3]
After Jan 2007: 00 26461 xxx xxxx[4]
Lesotho[edit]
Calls to Lesotho could be made using the access code 050 instead of the international code +266; for example, to call Maseru from South Africa, subscribers would dial 0501.[5]

Botswana, Swaziland and Zimbabwe[edit]
Calls to Botswana, Swaziland and Zimbabwe could similarly be made using the regional codes 0192, 0194 and 0191, respectively, instead of the international codes +267, +268 and +263.[6]

Number ranges[edit]
00[edit]
International access code effective from 16 October 2006 and mandatory from 16 January 2007.

Telephone numbers in South Korea are organized and assigned using the following scheme


Overview[edit]
International call out: 00N (where N is the carrier code) followed by the distant country code and telephone number.
Calling into Korea: +82 XX XXXX YYYY. The leading "0" is dropped when dialling into South Korea from abroad.
Some 1566/1577/1588 telephone numbers cannot be dialed from abroad.
Domestic long-distance call: 0NN (where NN is the carrier code) followed by the 0XX area code and XXXX YYYY number. See Domestic long-distance service code and Area code.
Call to cellular : 01N XXXX YYYY (see Mobile phone number). When phone call is made between unified 010-number subscribers, leading 010 can be dropped (XXXX YYYY).
Special service call : 0N0 XXXX YYYY (see Special service)
For example;

Call 02-312-3456 within Seoul: 312-3456
Call 02-312-3456 from elsewhere: 02-312-3456
Call 051-212-3456 within Busan: 212-3456
Call 051-212-3456 from elsewhere: 051-212-3456
Call 02-312-3456 from abroad: +82-2-312-3456
South Korea uses an open dialing plan with a total length (including 0) of 9 to 11 digits and, within city, subscriber numbers 7 to 8 digits long. Dialing from mobile phones to any type of phone except 010 numbers, the area code must be included.
In 1998, telephone numbers in Seoul starting with 2 and 6 added more digit (02-2XX-YYYY to 02-22XX-YYYY, 02-6XX-YYYY to 02-26XX-YYYY). Before area codes were shortened from 4 digit to 2~3 digit in June 2000, there were 1 digit exchange number (usually "2") with some 2 digit exchange numbers so some phone numbers like 0347-61-XXXX, 0443-2-XXXX or 0525-40-XXXX existed. (now 031-761-XXXX, 043-652-XXXX and 055-340-XXXX)

South Sudan telephone calling codes
"+211" redirects here. For other uses, see 211 (disambiguation).
Telephone numbers in South SudanLocationCountrySouth SudanContinentAfricaAccess codesCountry code+211International access00
South Sudan uses a two digit mobile code along with a seven digit phone number. For international calls, South Sudan has been assigned the +211 code by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Before its secession, the area later to  be known as South Sudan used Sudan's ITU. However, even after its secession, South Sudan used the Sudan country code +249 until 1 October. The government of the nation said the code number +211 would become active within 48 hours of recognition of the country by the United Nations (UN). The UN recognized South Sudan on 14 July 2011, and in so the United Nations suggested the code to become active by 16 July.[1] The code went "live" on 1 October 2011, over two months behind schedule.[2]


Service Provider codes[edit]
Each telephone service provider has a two-digit identifier. The first digit is 1 for fixed services, including wireline and fixed wireless, or 9 for GSM mobile services.[3]

National calls[edit]
Calls taking place inside of South Sudan have a simple format of mm nnn nnnn (where mm represents the mobile code and nnn nnnn represents the local number). An ITU is not required for national calls. For example, a person in South Sudan contacting another person in the same country with a mobile code of 55 and a local number of 555-5555 would have a telephone number of 55 555 5555.[4]

International calls[edit]
Inbound[edit]
Calls from outside South Sudan require a different dialing format to be used. International call prefixes, area codes, and phone numbers may vary. An inbound call has the format of +211 mm nnn nnnn (where mm represents the mobile code, and nnn nnnn represents the local number). The + represents the international call prefix used by the country where the call originates: for example, the United States and Canada use 011, and most other countries use 00. So for example, if someone from tried to call to the number 55-555-5555 in South Sudan from the United States, then one would use 011 211 55 555 5555.[5][6]

Telephone numbers in SpainLocationCountrySpainContinentEuropeRegulatorCMTTypeclosedAccess codesCountry code+34International access00Long-distancenone
The Spanish telephone numbering plan is the allocation of telephone numbers in Spain. It was previously regulated by the Comisión del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones (CMT), but is now regulated by the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC).


History[edit]
Before 1998, local telephone calls could be made using only the subscriber's number without the area code, while the trunk code '9' was omitted when calling from outside Spain, e.g.:[1]

xx[x] xx xx     (within the same province) 
9xx xxx xxx     (within Spain)   
+34 xx xxx xxx  (outside Spain)

International calls were made by dialling the international access code 07, waiting for a tone, and then dialling the country code.[2] However, calls to Gibraltar were made using the prefix '956' for the province of Cádiz, followed by the digit '7', instead of the country code +350, e.g.:[3]

7 xx xxx     (from Cádiz)
956 7 xx xxx (from the rest of Spain)

Similarly, calls to Andorra were made using the prefix '973' for the province of Lleida followed by the digit '8',[4] e.g.:

8 xx xxx        (from Lleida) 
9738 xx xxx     (from Spain)

It was also possible to call Andorra from other countries via Spain using the prefix +34 738 instead of via France using the prefix +33 628.[5] However, on 17 December 1994, Andorra adopted its own country code +376, with '8' being added to the subscriber's five-digit number, meaning that international dialling was required from Spain, e.g.:[6]

9738 xx xxx   (before 17 December 1994) 
07376 8xx xxx (after 17 December 1994)

Mobile phone numbers began with the prefix '90x' or '9x9', e.g.:[7]

9x9 xxx xxx     (within Spain)   
+34 x9 xxx xxx  (outside Spain)

Current numbering plan[edit]
On 1 December 1998, Spain changed to a new telephone numbering plan.[8] Under the closed numbering plan with the trunk prefix '9' being incorporated into the subscriber's number, so that a nine-digit number was used for all calls, e.g.:[9]

9xx xxx xxx      (within Spain)   
+34 9xx xxx xxx  (outside Spain)

Mobiles similarly changed, and were now prefixed with the digit '6':

 608 xxx xxx     (within Spain before 1998)
 +34 08 xxx xxx  (outside Spain before 1998) 
 +34 608 xxx xxx (since 1998)[10]

New numbering ranges have also since been introduced:

 10xx        Carrier selection codes
 5xx xxx xxx Personal Numbering
 7yx xxx xxx (since 2009–2010; note y cannot be 0 (zero) because this is allocated as a personal number, see below)
 8xx xxx xxx Geographic expansion 
 800 xxx xxx Freephone
 900 xxx xxx Freephone
 80x xxx xxx Shared-cost 
 90x xxx xxx Shared-cost

Spain's international access code also changed from 07 to 00, but this did not affect dialling arrangements for calls to Gibraltar, with the 9567 prefix being retained.[11] In addition, it was possible to call Gibraltar from other countries via Spain using the prefix +34 9567.[12] However, on 10 February 2007, Spain adopted the international prefix 00350 for all calls to Gibraltar, thereby bringing end to a dispute between Gibraltar and Spain.[13] Consequently, numbers with the prefix 9567 were withdrawn from use, and made available for reassignment to subscribers in Spain.[14]

Mobile phones[edit]
Mobile phone numbers begin with 6 or 7, followed by 8 digits (6xx xxx xxx or 7yx xxx xxx), where y can be 1 to 9, not 0 (zero).  Note, numbers starting with 70 are personal numbers which can  be re-directed to any other number by the personal owner.  Since the blocks of mobile phone numbers are allocated according to demand from the service providers, there is not necessarily a unique service provider indicated by the three digit numbering group (6xx or 7yx).
In October 2009, new legislation was approved to grant the allocation of up to 80,000,000 new numbers beginning with number 7 (followed by 8 digits) to supplement the existing group beginning with number 6 (followed by 8 digits); due to the lack of available numbers to satisfy the increasing demand for mobile phone and other mobile / wireless services.[15]

Personal numbering[edit]
Personal numbers are used as redirection IDs. The owner of a personal number may request, for example, any call to its personal number to be redirected to any other number it wants.
Personal numbers begin with 5, followed by 8 digits.

Other numbers[edit]
Numbers starting with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 99 are reserved.
Numbers starting with 0 and 1 are used to compose short numbers or for prefixes. For example, three-digit numbers starting with 0 are for emergency and services to the citizen.
Non-emergency numbers are 010 for requesting information to the city council, 012 to the regional government, and 060 to the national government.
016, implemented in 2007 by the national government, is a telephone number meant for reporting cases of violence against women. Calls to this number do not appear in the phone bill.[16]
112 is the generic emergency number. Specific emergency numbers are 061 for medical emergencies (only some of the autonomous communities offer this number, elsewhere 112 must be called), 062 for the Civil Guard, 080 or 085 for the fire brigade (depending on the province), 091 for the National Police, 092 for the municipal police.
Five-digit numbers starting with 118 are information numbers.
Numbers starting with 80 and 90, then a number different from 0, are used for premium rates, toll free, and internet access numbers.
905 numbers are supposed to be used for voting systems. Calls have a limited duration (typically 3 minutes), and are charged a fixed rate per call. They are often used in TV shows as a substitutive of 80 numbers, both for image reasons and because operators are not obliged to block them on a user request, as 80 numbers are.[17]
Until 2003, 906 used to be the prefix for premium rate calls, where the calling party pays a fixed amount of money per minute and are lucrative for the called party. In that year, 906 was discontinued and split in three: 803 for phone sex, 806 for entertainment, gambling and various services such as divination, and 807 for professional services such as legal and medical advice.[18][19]
908 and 909 were designed to be the numbers for dial-up Internet access. However, they have been widely replaced by digital subscriber line and faster Internet access technologies. 907 was the prefix for dial-up access to premium rate websites.
800 and 900 numbers are freephone numbers in Spain. The called party pays the cost of the call.[19]
901 and 902 numbers are Non Geographic Numbers. These have been widely introduced by the call centres of large multinational European businesses. Unlike other normal Spanish phone numbers beginning 910 onwards, 901 and 902 numbers are always excluded from inclusive call bundles on Spanish landlines and mobiles. In 901 lines, the cost of the call is shared between the calling party and the receiver; in a 902, the calling party pays all the cost of the call.[19] 902 numbers are extremely expensive to call from Spanish mobiles. 901 and 902 numbers are also premium rated if calling Spain from overseas and low cost international call carriers to Spain normally refuse to connect calls to 901 and 902 numbers.

Telephone numbers in SurinameLocationCountrySurinameContinentSouth AmericaAccess codesCountry code+597International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Suriname are administered by the Surinamese government. Since 2017 the responsibility is at the ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communication and in the period of 1991 to 2017 of the ministry of Transport, Communication and Tourism.[1] The International dialling code is +597.[2] Suriname uses a number plan introduced in 2008.[3]


Telephone numbering plan[edit]
Suriname uses the following National Significant Numbers (NSN):

Minimum number length (excluding the country code): six digits.
Maximum number length (excluding the country code): seven digits.
The international dialling format is as follows:

Mobile: +597 XXX XXXX
Fixed: +597 XXX XXX
History[edit]
Until 1969, a system was used with 2-digit area codes and local numbers varying from 2 to 5 digits depending on the area. Around 1969/1970 this was changed to a closed numbering system with 5-digit numbers nationwide; a zero had to be dialled before the number. At that time, some areas were not automated yet.[4]

Telephone numbers in SwedenLocation of Sweden in dark greenLocationCountrySwedenContinentEuropeRegulatorSwedish Post and Telecom AuthorityTypeOpenNSN  length7 to 13 digitsNumbering planSweden National Numbering PlanLast updated22 May 2018Access codesCountry code+46International access00Long-distance0
In Sweden, the area codes are, including the leading 0, two, three or four digits long, with larger towns and cities having shorter area codes permitting a larger number of telephone numbers in the eight to ten digits used (including the leading '0'). Before the 1990s, ten-digit numbers were very rare, but they have become increasingly common because of the deregulation of telecommunications, the new 112 emergency number (which required change of all numbers starting with 11), and the creation of a single area code for the Greater Stockholm area. No subscriber number is shorter than five digits. The longest subscriber numbers have eight digits (only in the Stockholm area).


History[edit]
The first automatic telephony in Sweden was operating in 1924 within a small area in Stockholm. Area codes were introduced around 1935 for usage in automatic national telephony.[1] 330 areas with three or four digits were allocated with 010 for Stockholm, and maximum nine digits in total as a technical limit. In order to allow more numbers including seven digit local numbers in Stockholm, in 1964 Stockholm changed from 010 to 08. Automatic international calls were introduced in 1965 with the prefix 009, changed to 00 in 1999. In 1992 all area codes beginning with 07 were allocated as 08 plus eight digits (the nine digits technical limit was then bypassed), and 07 was allocated for wireless applications such as mobile phones. Analog mobile phones had been using 010.

Sweden adopted 00 as its international access code in 1999 replacing 009, 007 and 008x. Carrier pre-selection was introduced at the same time.
According to the postal and telecommunication services supervising authority Post- och Telestyrelsen, it seems possible that Sweden will adopt a closed numbering plan in the future.[citation needed]

Telephone numbers in Switzerland are defined and assigned according to the Swiss telephone numbering plan administered by the Swiss Federal Office of Communications. The plan has been changed several times and the most recent reorganization was implemented in March 2002.

Plan of 2002[edit]
The Swiss telephone numbering plan implements the ITU-T recommendation E.164 and is designated E.164/2002, based on its last major revision in 2002. It is a closed numbering plan,[1] which means that all telephone numbers, including the area code, have a fixed number of digits. Swiss area codes are officially termed national destination codes (NDC). A complete telephone number consists of ten digits:  0xx xxx xx xx. Two formats are distinguished: three digits for the NDC and seven digits for the subscriber number, and four digits for the NDC and six digits for the subscriber number. However, a few exceptions exist.
The associated dial plan requires that all numbers, even for local calls, must be dialed with the assigned NDC, in contrast to previous plans. When dialing from within the country, a prefix 0 must be dialed.
The plan was amended a few times, e.g., the transition of numbering zone 01 into 044 and 043.

National destination code[edit]

The national destination code (NDC) is the area code for Swiss telephone numbers. Within Switzerland the trunk code 0 must be dialed before the NDC, while it is not needed from international locations.
Telephone numbers are portable between numbering zones (ZN) or between mobile operators, and therefore an NDC does not imply that a caller is actually located in a particular zone or is serviced by any particular mobile operator. For landlines it is now merely an indication of the region where the number was originally attributed to a subscriber.
The national destination codes are the following.[2]

Alternate proposed plan[edit]
Instead of E.164/2002, another more ambitious numbering plan was proposed. In this plan the prefix 0 was discarded, and the area codes were defined differently, with 20 to 49 for geographic areas, 50 to 59 reserved, 60-69 for nationwide numbering, 70-79 for mobile services, 80-89 for shared-cost and toll-free numbers, and 90 for premium-rate services. The plan was not implemented because it required too many phone number and prefix changes, with associated high costs.

Changes[edit]
After 2002[edit]
The area code 01 was replaced with 044 (Zurich)

Between 1996 and 2002 (plan 2002)[edit]
On 29 March 2002 the Swiss dialing plan changed to a closed dialing plan, i.e. the zone prefix become mandatory also for local calls.

058 - Corporate access (since 1 June 2000)
Until 1996 (plan 1996)[edit]
The previous plan removed a lot of area prefixes and added the seventh digit in phone numbers (usually a phone number (0cc) yx xx xx became (0dd) zzx xx xx).

International borders[edit]
The German municipality of Büsingen am Hochrhein, an enclave within the canton of Schaffhausen, uses the Swiss telecom network, with numbers having the prefix 052, alongside that of Germany, from which numbers must be dialled in the international format as 004152.[6]
The Italian municipality of Campione d'Italia, an exclave within the Swiss canton of Ticino, uses the Swiss telephone network and is part of the Swiss numbering plan, although some Italian numbers are in use by the municipal council, which use the same +39 031 numbering range as the town of Como.[7]
Liechtenstein previously used the Swiss telephone numbering plan with the area code 075.[8] (This was dialled as +41 75 from outside Switzerland and Liechtenstein).[9] However, on 5 April 1999, it adopted its own international code +423.[10] Consequently, calls from Switzerland now require international dialling, using the 00423 prefix and the seven-digit number.[11]

Telephone area codes in Taiwan.
Telephone numbers in the Republic of China (Taiwan) use a system of area codes, beginning 02 to 08. The leading digit(s) following the area code denote the network operator (Chunghwa Telecom and its competitors). Mobile numbers begin 09. The international code for calls into Taiwan is 886.


Area codes[edit]
Source:[1]
The emergency numbers in Taiwan are 110 (police) and 119 (fire and ambulance services).
When making an inter-area long-distance call from within Taiwan, a long-distance prefix "0" is required. If calls are made from within the same area code, then the area code does not need to be included. Inter-area calls are defined as long-distance phone calls even when the two numbers have the same prefix.
If calls are made from outside Taiwan, the "0" of the area code prefix is omitted.
The following table of area codes includes this "0" prefix.

Mobile phones[edit]
Taiwan mobile phone numbers always begin with 09 followed by 8 digits (e.g. 0918909875). The 0 is omitted when calling a Taiwan mobile phone number from outside Taiwan (e.g. +88 01771292198). If calling a landline within Taiwan from a local Taiwan mobile phone, the 0 of area code prefix must be included (e.g. 0 + area code + 8 digit landline number).
Prefixes: (09)XXXX-XXXX
896-786
Mobile Phones (090 range is mostly used for wireless data services, M2M).

Toll-free and premium rate[edit]
Toll-free numbers begin with the prefix 0800 and 0809.[3]
Numbers in the 020x prefix are used for value-added services:[4]

International dialling[edit]
International dialling from Taiwan follows the following pattern:

Carrier selection code – Country calling code – Area code (if required, usually for landlines) – Subscriber number

Carrier selection codes, which direct the call via one of several providers, are as follows:

002 – Chunghwa Telecom
005 – Asia Pacific Telecom
006 – Taiwan Mobile
007 – Far EasTone
009 – Chunghwa Telecom
Country calling code[edit]
The international dialling code for making calls to Taiwan, and the other islands is 886.
International dialling codes were assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an agency of the United Nations, to its member states and their dependencies in the 1960s. Despite the Republic of China on Taiwan still being a member of the UN, and hence the ITU, other member states declared that "the only representatives of the people of China are the delegates to the ITU and its permanent organs appointed by the Central Government of the People's Republic of China".[5] This led to the People's Republic of China being assigned the country code 86.[6] Consequently, in the early 1970s, Taiwan had to be unofficially assigned a separate code, 886, although there was pressure from China to change this to 866.[7] This had to be listed as "reserved",[8] but in 2006, the code was formally allocated to "Taiwan, China".[9][10]

The following are the telephone codes in Tanzania. 


Format[edit]
+255 XXX XXX XXX +255XX XXX XXXX calling from outside Tanzania
0XXX XXX XXX or 0XX XXX XXXX - calling within Tanzania
The NSN length is nine digits.

Subscriber Number length under 2X, 4X, 6X and 7X NDCs is 7 digits.
Subscriber Number length under 8XY and 90X NDCs is 6 digits.
Calls between Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda[edit]
Calls to Kenya and Uganda require a regional prefix rather than having to use full international dialling. To call Kenya from Tanzania, subscribers dial 005 instead of +254, while to call Uganda, they dial 006 rather instead of +256. To call Tanzania from Kenya and Uganda, subscribers dial 007 instead of +255.
Until 1999, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda shared a telephone numbering plan, in which subscribers were only required to dial the trunk code, area code and number. In that year, Tanzania adopted a new numbering plan.

Telephone numbers in ThailandLocationCountryThailandContinentAsiaRegulatorNational Broadcasting and Telecommunications CommissionTypeclosedNSN  length8-9Access codesCountry code+66International access00Long-distance0
Thailand's telephone numbering plan in Thailand is managed by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) in accordance with International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) recommendation E.164.[1]


Geographic area codes[edit]

Geographic (fixed line) area codes are, excluding the STD prefix one digit in Bangkok and nearby provinces (area code 2) and two digits in all other provinces (area codes 3x, 4x, 5x, and 7x). In Thailand, an area code is usually shared by several provinces and roughly follows provincial borders.
Fixed-line subscriber numbers are six digits in Thailand (except Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan, i.e., area code 2). Prior to 1980, subscriber numbers were six digits in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan. In 1980, subscriber numbers in these areas were expanded to seven digits in phases to meet new demands. The first digit of a subscriber number is associated with a specific locale within the area code. In Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan, the second digit of a subscriber number identifies the service provider, which is almost always Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), as TOT holds a near-monopoly of the Thai fixed-line market.
Thus, a full national number is 9 digits, including the STD prefix 0. When writing a telephone number with the area code, the area code and subscriber number are separated by a hyphen, also in the middle of subscriber number. Examples:

A number 2134567 in Bangkok: 02-2134567
A number 213456 in Nakhon Ratchasima: 044-213456
Thailand switched to a closed dialing plan in 2021, which means that calling within the area code requires the area code to be dialed. E.g., When calling a number 2134567 in Bangkok (02) from a fixed-line phone:

Within Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan: 02-2134567
Outside Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan: 02-2134567
Outside Thailand: +66-2-2134567 (the initial 0 of the area code is omitted)

Mobile phone codes and IP telephony[edit]
Mobile phone codes are in area codes 8 and 9, and VoIP are in the area code 6, plus a second digit, resulting in two digits excluding the leading zero.
Originally, each mobile phone operator was issued one mobile phone code. Through a series of mergers, there are currently three major mobile phone operators: AIS, True and DTAC. As existing numbers run out, the three mobile phone operators are assigned numbers in code 081, distinguished by the first digit of the subscriber number.
A mobile phone number consists of a mobile phone code and a seven-digit subscriber number. Therefore, a mobile phone number is written as 0641163685
Mobile phones in Thailand use 900/1800 MHz for GSM. Domestic roaming service is available free within Thailand in places where there is only a single transmitter in place due to restrictions.
As codes are being exhausted, a new range, 09x, is available for assignment. Despite the length of the code, subscriber numbers are seven digits, resulting in a ten-digit national number including the leading zero. Starting 28 April 2011, the prefix 090 followed by seven digits was available for use.

International dialling[edit]
International dialling from Thailand follows the following pattern:

Carrier selection code – Country calling code – Area code (if required, usually for landlines) – Subscriber number

Carrier selection codes, which direct the call via one of several providers, are as follows:[4]

001 – CAT Telecom
003 – Advanced Wireless Network
004 – Total Access Communication
005 – AIN Globalcom
006 – True Move
009 – CAT Telecom (low cost, using VoIP)
Emergency numbers[edit]
As of 2021[update] Thailand has nearly 100 "hotline" telephone numbers to call for assistance. They include 911 or 191 for emergencies,[5] fire, or unwanted intruding animals; 1699 or 1669 (or 1646 or 1554 in Bangkok) for medical emergencies; tourist police, 1155; car theft, 1192; a taxi refusing a trip, 1584; road accidents, 1146.[6]

Telephone numbers in TurkeyLocationCountryTurkeyContinentEuropeTypeClosedNSN  length10Format0 (xxx) xxx xx xxAccess codesCountry code+90International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in Turkey went from six (2+4) to seven digits (3+4) local phone numbers c.1988, at which time Ankara went from 41 to 4. There used to be more than 5,000 local area codes of varying lengths (one to five digits) with correspondingly varying local number lengths (seven to three digits).
The new system is based on 3 three-digit area codes for provinces and seven digit local phone numbers. Istanbul is the exception and it gets two area codes ([212] for the European and [216] for the Asian side).
Calling a cell phone from outside Turkey is the same except the three digit numbers are replaced with the ones of the companies. Like [9] + [0] + [cell company id number] + [seven digit number]. The following are the company identification numbers for the major mobile telephone providers: Turkcell (530-539, 561 61X XXXX, 516 16X XXXX), Vodafone (540-549), Türk Telekom (500-509 and 550-559) and NETGSM (510 22X XXXX).[1][2]
Local numbers in most areas were also changed in conjunction with the numbering plan that took effect 30 August 1993.
If a former area code is indicated, this is for the major centre in the new area code's district. The new area codes will also replace former area codes other than the primary one mentioned.


General information[edit]
The country calling code of Turkey is 90.

Language digit[clarification needed]: 0 (Direct Dialing)
Language digit: 2 (Operator Assistance)
National (significant) number: 10 Digits.
Area code: 3 digits
Local subscriber's number: 7 digits.
Only exception in this is the call center numbers which start with 444, the call center numbers cannot be dialed with area code, they must be dialed with 7 digit from any phone (Landlines & Mobiles) in the country. The number format is 444 XX XX. For dialing the Call Center numbers from other countries, the number must be dialed as Country Code + Call Center Number like 90 444 XX XX. If you dial the Call Center number with the area code you will hear an IVR announce saying you must not use area code while dialing the call center number.
Dialing procedure:
A call from another country would have the following dialing format:

Telephone numbers in TuvaluLocationCountryTuvaluContinentOceaniaAccess codesCountry code+688International access00
Country Code: +688
International Call Prefix: 00


Landlines[edit]
The local telephone numbers in Tuvalu are five digits long with no leading trunk zero to be omitted by international callers.  The first two digits relate to the Tuvalu island in which is being called.[1]  The remaining three digits are for the local number; however, when calling within the same island, all five digits must be dialled.

Atoll codes[edit]
Each of the nine atolls (districts) of Tuvalu has a dialing code, apart from Funafuti which has two.

Mobile telephones[edit]

WNP:[2]
The mobile network was destroyed in a storm in 2007, and rebuilt in 2009.[3]

Other numbers[edit]
The telephone operator can be contacted on 20006 and the emergency services can be contacted on 911.  Tuvalu has generated a lot of revenue from running adult entertainment lines via their country's dialing code [4] (usually beginning with 62), however due to political and religious reasons they have decided to put a stop to this.[5]

Until 1999, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda shared a telephone numbering plan, in which subscribers were only required to dial the trunk code, area code and number. In that year, this was discontinued following Tanzania's adoption of a new numbering plan, although calls between the three countries only required regional prefixes rather than international dialling. To call Uganda from Tanzania and Kenya, subscribers dial 006 instead of +256.

Telephone number system in Ukraine
Telephone numbers in UkraineLocation of UkraineLocationCountryUkraineContinentEuropeRegulatorMinistry of InfrastructureTypeClosedNSN  length9Format(xx) xxx xxxx(xxx) xx xxxx(xxxx) xxxxxAccess codesCountry code+380International access00Long-distance0List of Ukraine dialing codesThis is a discussion of telephone numbers in Ukraine. The nation of Ukraine has country code +380. It switched to the European Union's common dialing plan in 2009. Thus, Ukrainian phone numbers consist of a 2-digit zone code, an optional subzone code, an optional filler (zero to two "2"'s), and the local phone number (five to seven digits). However, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk were given Russian telephone codes instead, as if they were following telephone numbers in Russia.

2009 dialing plan[edit]
On 14 October 2009, Ukraine switched to the dialing conventions common in the European Union.[1]
In order to call abroad, users need to dial 00 before the country code. For instance, to call Vancouver, Canada, from Kyiv, users dial 00 1 604 xxx xxxx.
Calling nationwide requires dialing 0 and then the region code followed by the local number. For instance, to call Kyiv from Odesa, users dial 0 44 xxx xxxx. The same convention was adopted for mobile operators.
For local calls, users can still dial the local number without a 0 and the area code. Mobile users must dial the full 0-prefixed number, although operators may implement local dialing in cities.
The in-country sequence for ordinary zones consists of a 2-digit zone code, an optional subzone code (never used for the capital of the geographic region corresponding to a phone zone), an optional filler (0 to 2 "2"s, used to make the whole in-country sequence contain exactly 9 digits) and the local phone number (5 to 7 digits). When dialing from cell phones, the in-country dial sequence (with the 0 XX prefix) is used even for phones of the same provider. Otherwise a call may be placed in the nearest geographic area.
Area codes correspond to geographic regions ("oblasts") with exception of Kyiv and formerly Sevastopol which utilize their own area code.  See Area codes in Ukraine for current list.
Cell phone numbers can be assigned both within the cell phone provider zone and within a geographic zone. The latter arrangement is used mainly for CDMA phones and for GSM operators selling their connectivity within one city, like GoldenTelecom GSM. Allocation of new GSM cell phone numbers within a geographic zone is very rare now because law requires all incoming calls to be free, including incoming calls to a cell phone.
Some examples of dialed sequences:

xxx-xx-xx          (two PSTN phones within Kyiv, local number is 7 digits long)
050 xxx-xx-xx      (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone to 
                    Vodafone, cell phone provider)
067 xxx-xx-xx      (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone to 
                    Kyivstar, cell phone provider)
0800 xxx-xxx       (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone to toll-free number)
044 xxx-xx-xx      (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside the Kyiv 
                    phone zone to Kyiv)
045 94x-xx-xx      (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside the
                    Brovary region phone zone to Brovary)
046 xxx-xx-xx      (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside 
                    the Chernihiv phone zone to Chernihiv)
032 2xx-xx-xx      (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside 
                    the Lviv phone zone to Lviv; the local number is 6 digits long, 
                    so "2" is used as a filler to make the whole in-country dial sequence 
                    9 digits long)
00 ...             (mobile or fixed international call from Ukraine)
+380 44 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Kyiv)
+380 45 94x-xx-xx  (international call to Brovary)
+380 48 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Odesa)
+380 48 2xx-xx-xx  (international call to 6-digit numbers in Odesa)
+380 32 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Lviv)
+380 32 2xx-xx-xx  (international call to 6-digit numbers in Lviv)
+380 50 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Vodafone)
+380 66 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Vodafone)
+380 95 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Vodafone)
+380 99 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Vodafone)
+380 63 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to lifecell)
+380 73 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to lifecell) 
+380 93 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to lifecell)
+380 67 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Kyivstar)
+380 68 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Kyivstar)
+380 96 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Kyivstar)
+380 97 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Kyivstar)
+380 98 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Kyivstar)
+380 91 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to 3mob) 
+380 92 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to PEOPLEnet)
+380 94 xxx-xx-xx  (international call to Intertelecom)

Law explicitly prohibits trunk calls to a PSTN phone within the same local area in a geographic phone zone (e.g. from Kyiv to Kyiv), so one cannot dial 0~2 or 0~xx for this, unless the phone exchange is misconfigured or a special circumstance occurs.
The switch to a closed numbering plan, which will introduce seven digit-long numbers for all zones, should be complete in 2011-2012.[2]
Notice, that when using older non-digital extensions for the inter-city, international calls as well as the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, it may be necessary to wait for a continuous dial tone after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital dial phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kyiv, one needs to dial 0, wait for a dial tone, then dial 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then dial the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to dial 0, wait for the dial tone, dial another 0 to access international line, then dial 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.
Due to the last digit of the country code (+380) being identical to the trunk prefix (0), international format numbers are often mistakenly presented as +38 0..., e.g. as in the (fictional) Kyiv number +38 044 555 1234, because people tend to mistakenly think that the last digit of the country code and the trunk prefix are the same number just being swapped around. +38 belonged to Yugoslavia before its disintegration in the early 1990s, and the +38 code was broken up and distributed amongst the former republics. +380 went to Ukraine, which previously used the +7 code.

Previous dialing plan[edit]
Ukraine (similarly to most of ex-Soviet Union countries) used to have a four-level (local, zone, country, international) open dialing plan. For all non-local numbers, the required trunk prefix was '8' followed by an auxiliary dial tone after it (optional on digital exchanges), with the following '2' for in-zone calls, followed by an area code, and '10' for international calls.

Russian invasion[edit]
Following the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian-occupied regions of the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol were issued with the Russian telephone codes +7 352[3] and +7 869 respectively.
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian-occupied regions of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics were issued with the Russian telephone codes of +7 856, +7 949 and +7 857, +7 959 respectively.[4][5] Whilst the Kherson[6] and Zaporizhzhia[7] Oblasts were considered incorporated into the Russian Federation by Russia, these regions were not given area codes that are part of the Russian telephone numbering plan. They currently use Russian and/or Ukrainian cellular phone numbers and/or the existing Ukrainian fixed area codes. Whilst the situation ever changes on the ground the exact usage of phone numbers in these areas thus varies.

Telephone numbers in Uruguay use the calling code +598. In 2010, national long distance calling was eliminated, and area codes were dropped.
ANTEL (Spanish abbreviation for National Administration of Telecommunications) is Uruguay's state-owned company for telecommunications.


History[edit]
Original phone numbers had between 4 and 7 digits. To make a local phone call, those digits were all that were necessary. To make a call between two cities from different departments, required dialing zero, an area code, and the local number.
On August 29, 2010, all phone numbers were changed 8 digits, according to the National Numbering Plan. Area codes were eliminated. This plan was implemented by URSEC (Spanish abbreviation for Regulator Unit of Services of Communications).

National Numbering Plan[edit]
Montevideo metropolitan area[edit]
In the metropolitan area, national numbers begin with 2. This 8-digit number consists of the former area code (2), followed by the old 7-digit number.

International calling[edit]
For calls from outside the country into Uruguay, the country code (+598) is prefixed to the 8-digit national number, while replacing the "+" with the international calling prefix used in the originating country.

Mobile telephony[edit]
When mobile telephony arrived in Uruguay, Movicom BellSouth was the only service provider. Mobile phone numbers began with digits 09, followed by 6 digits: 09xxxxxx.
In 1994, ANTEL started its own mobile phone service, creating Ancel, which later merged into Antel. This created a numbering change for mobile telephony. One number was assigned to each company to identify their numbers. This digit varied between 09 and the number. Movicom was assigned to 4, and Ancel to 9. Movicom numbers changed to 094xxxxxx, and new Ancel numbers became 099xxxxxx.
In 2003, Claro came to Uruguay (originally as CTI Móvil). Numbers of this company were prefixed by 096: 096xxxxxx.
In 2004, Telefónica bought Movicom Bellsouth and changed its name to Movistar.
When the companies reached one million users, they had to be assigned other prefixes.

Antel (ADMINISTRACIÓN NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES): 099, 098, 092 and 091.
Movistar (TELEFONICA MOVILES DE URUGUAY S.A.): 094, 095 and 093.
Claro (AM WIRELESS URUGUAY S.A.): 096 and 097.
URSEC has reserved 084, 089 and 086 for a possible future use.

Telephone numbers in VenezuelaLocationCountryVenezuelaContinentSouth AmericaAccess codesCountry code+58International access00Long-distance0
The Venezuelan Numbering Plan is an open telephone numbering plan with three-digit area codes and seven-digit telephone numbers that directs telephone calls to particular regions on a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or to a mobile telephone network, where they are further routed by the local network. The last revision of the current numbering plan is September 21, 2000.
Example landline calls (using Caracas as reference):

           5551212  (within metropolitan area)
      0212 5551212  (within Venezuela, Caracas excluded)
011 58 212 5551212  (from the U.S./Canada to Venezuela)

Other area codes[edit]
Codes starting with 1XX specify a particular carrier to route a call to (XX denotes the carrier code).[1]
Codes starting with 5 are region-free and are treated as local calls wherever the calling party is dialing from (within Venezuela only).
Codes starting with 8 are toll-free numbers.
Codes starting with 9 are assigned to premium rate services.
Notes[edit]


^ Despite being specified in the last revision of the Venezuelan numbering plan, no carrier has implemented this type of service yet.

This is a discussion of telephone numbers in Vietnam. Vietnam's country code is +84. There are many area codes for land lines, as well as a separate format for mobile phone numbers. The five emergency phone numbers are 111 (child protection), 112 (lifesaving services), 113 (police), 114 (fire), and 115 (first aid).


Land lines[edit]
Land line phone numbers in Vietnam follow the format Area Code + Phone Number. The area codes depend on the province and/or city.
To dial a number within the same province or city, only the phone number needs to be dialed.
When dialing from a different province/city or from a mobile phone, follow the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number.
At the moment, area codes may have from 2 to 3 digits, while phone numbers may have from 7 to 8 digits, in total, the land line phone numbers in Vietnam have 11 numbers included trunk code (0).
The different area codes are described below.

Mobile telephone numbers[edit]
[1][2] 
In Vietnam, mobile phone numbers follow the format 09x-xxxxxxx or new prefixes: 03x, 05x, 07x, 08x. 

The first 0 is the trunk code.
The next 2 digits (3x, 5x, 7x, 8x or 9y) specify the mobile phone operator. Some mobile phone operators have been given more than one operator code.

In Circular No. 22/2014/TT-BTTTT dated December 22, 2014, all 11-digit mobile phone numbers will be changed into 10-digit numbers, the Ministry of Information and Communications announced in a recent press release. All 11-digit numbers with prefixes '012' of VinaPhone and MobiFone, '016' of Viettel, '018' of Vietnamobile and '019' of GMobile will be converted into 10-digit ones. To minimize possible loss of communications before, during and after network code change, each stage must consist of four steps as follows:

Make public announcement at least 60 days before the network code change starts.
Take technical measures to enable simultaneous dialing for 60 days since the network code change starts. Example: users may dial old or new network code 0986888888 to Viettel.
Maintain the notification sound (since the time of simultaneous dialing closes). During this time, any call using new network codes shall be normally processed and any call using old network codes shall be routed to the notification sound.
Stop maintaining the notification sound: Calls shall be successful processed only through new network codes. To ensure changing of network codes is quick and favorable for businesses and service users, step a aforementioned should be implemented for one stage.
In Communication of 31.V.2018 the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC), Hanoi, announced a change on mobile telephony services, where all previous telephone numbers starting with 012x (mobile telephony services numbers) are moving into the other mobile number areas (e.g. to 07x or 08x etc.)[3]  .

Zimbabwe telephone calling codes


Telephone numbers in ZimbabweZimbabwe (dark green)LocationCountryZimbabweContinentAfricaNSN  length9Access codesCountry code+263International access00Long-distance0
The following are the telephone codes in Zimbabwe.


Local Calls[edit]
This section is empty.  You can help by adding to it.  (August 2021)
In the same town/city[edit]
For calls inside the same geographic numbering area (local calls), dial the Subscriber Number only (this includes the Prefixing Number).[1]

To another town/city[edit]
To make a call from one town or city to another within Zimbabwe, a subscriber should dial the area code (with the preceding zero "0"), followed by the New Added Prefixing Number, and the required subscriber number.[1]

International calls[edit]
Zimbabwe was allocated its own country code by the International Telecommunication Union, +263, in the late 1960s, when it was known as Rhodesia.[2]

To call a Zimbabwean number from  another country: dial: the international access code (i.e. 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America), followed by the country code (263), followed by the area code, and then the required subscriber number.[1]  Example for calling a subscriber in Harare, Zimbabwe, dail: 00 263 24 2xx xxx (x= subscriber number).  The zero (0) at the beginning of the area code is dropped when calling with the country code (263). Until the 1990s, calls to Zimbabwe could be made from South Africa using the regional code 0194.[3]
For international calls from Zimbabwe, dial the international Access Prefix "00" followed by the country code and the National Significant Number for the subscriber.[1]  Until 1996, the international access code was 110.[4]

Telephone numbers in Czech RepublicLocationCountryCzech RepublicContinentEuropeTypeClosedFormatxxx xxx xxxAccess codesCountry code+420International access00Long-distancenone
Following the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the successor states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, continued to share the 42 country code until 28 February 1997, with the Czech Republic then adopting 420 and Slovakia adopting 421.[1]
On September 22, 2002, the Czech Republic adopted a closed numbering plan, with nine-digit numbers used for local and national calls, and the dropping of the trunk code 0.
Before the change, the following arrangements would have been made for calls to Brno:

Local call:         xx xx xx xx
National call:      05/xx xx xx xx
International call: +420 5 xx xx xx xx

After the change, the dialing arrangements for calls to Brno were as follows:

Within Czech Republic:  5xx xxx xxx
Outside Czech Republic: +420 5xx xxx xxx

In the case of mobile numbers, which had to be dialed in full, the only change was that the 0 was no longer used:

Within Czech Republic:  602 xxx xxx 
Outside Czech Republic: +420 602 xxx xxx


Emergency calls (always toll-free)[edit]
General emergency: 112
Ambulance: 155
Police: 158
Fire brigade: 150
Municipal police: 156
Mountain rescue service: 1210
Other Emergency Numbers:

Urgent gas leak: 1239
Emergency Road Service (ABA): 1240
Emergency Road Service (UAMK): 1230
Services Numbers[edit]
O2 offers several over-the-phone information services for a fee. Note that many of the services are offered only in Czech:

Info Line (Czech Number Directory): 1180
Info Line (Foreign Number Directory): 1181
Operator for changed numbers (re-numbering): 141 11
Information on air quality: 141 10
Exact time: 141 12
Weather: 141 16
Medical Information: 141 20
Operator for international phone calls: 133 003
Prefixes[edit]
The first 1-3 digits (after +420) of the telephone number indicates location or network. For mobile phones, since there is number portability, the mobile phone code only indicates the original operator. For example, when a person calls a number starting with 73 (T-Mobile) but had been ported to another operator, a short voice message in Czech and English is played stating "you are calling out of a T-Mobile network" before the ringing tone. It is possible to disable this voice message.

Telephone numbering in the Faroe Islands
Telephone numbers in Faroe IslandsLocation of Faroe IslandsLocationCountryFaroe IslandsContinentEuropeFormat+298 NX XX XXAccess codesCountry code+298International access00
Telephone numbers in the Faroe Islands have used a closed numbering plan, with 6-digit subscriber's numbers since 1998.[1]  Numbers are usually printed in three groups of two digits.  E.g. Tórshavn municipality's city hall has the telephone number 30 20 10.[2]
Unusually for countries in Europe, the Faroe Islands were assigned the country calling code by the International Telecommunication Union beginning with the digit "2", in common with countries in Africa.[3] At the time, however, all country codes beginning with "3" and "4", reserved for countries in Europe, were already in use.[4] Originally, telephone numbers in the Faroe Islands could be reached using the country code for Denmark, +45, followed by the area code 42.[5]
Calls to Denmark require the use of the international access code 00 and country code 45; previously, only the digit 0 was required before the subscriber's eight-digit number, with calls to the rest of the world using the international access code 009 and the country code.[6]

Telephone numbers in NetherlandsMap of telephone codesLocationCountryNetherlandsContinentEuropeTypeClosedNSN  length9Format0xx xxxxxxx / 0xxx xxxxxx (geographical)  06 xxxxxxxx (mobile)Access codesCountry code+31International access00Long-distance0
Telephone numbers in the Netherlands are administered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation of the Netherlands. The telephone numbering plan may be grouped into three general categories: geographical numbers, non-geographical numbers, and numbers for public services.
Geographical telephone numbers have nine digits and consist of an area code of two or three digits and a subscriber number of seven or six digits, respectively. When dialled within the country, the number must be prefixed with the trunk access code 0, identifying a destination telephone line in the Dutch telephone network.
Non-geographical numbers have no fixed length, but also require the dialling of the trunk access code (0). They are used for mobile telephone networks and other designated service types, such as toll-free dialling, Internet access, voice over IP, restricted audiences, and information resources.
In addition, special service numbers exist for emergency response, directory assistance, and other services by the public authorities.


Numbering plan[edit]
The telephone numbering plan of the Netherlands is divided into geographical, non-geographical, and special public resource telephone numbers. The dial plan prescribes that within the country dialling both geographical and non-geographical numbers requires a national network access code, which is the digit 0. The following list includes this national trunk access digit when it must be dialled before the number.

Number information

066, 084 and 087 are often used by scammers, because they are easy and cheap to register and make identification very hard.[citation needed]
Previously, 06-0, 06-1000 and 06-4 were used for toll-free numbers, 06-8 for shared cost, 06-9 for premium rate, and other 06-numbers for mobile numbers. 0011 and later 06-11 was used for emergency services before this changed to 112. 09 was used as the international access code before this changed to 00.

Geographical telephone numbers[edit]
Since the reorganization of the telephone system in 1995, Dutch geographical numbers consist of 9 digits. The numbering plan implements a system of area codes. An area code consists of two or three digits. The larger cities and areas have two digits with a subscriber number of seven digits, permitting more local numbers. Smaller areas use three digits with a six-digit subscriber number.
Geographic numbers are allocated in blocks to telecommunications providers. However, a telephone number from a block allocated to a certain provider may no longer be serviced by the original assignee due to number portability; subscribers who switch providers can take their number with them.
When dialled within the Netherlands, the domestic trunk access code 0 must be dialled before the telephone number, extending the dialling sequence to 10 digits. If dialling from overseas, the 0 (Zero) in front of the prefix must be omitted.
Before the 1995 reorganization, area codes were restricted to towns. This was lifted and multiple towns may now share an area code. The following table lists only one town for each area code, and it includes the trunk access code (0).

Non-geographical telephone numbers[edit]
The non-geographic numbers do not have a prescribed fixed number of digits, but are usually kept as short as possible. Mobile telephone numbers, however, always have 10 digits,[1] just like geographic numbers.
The non-geographical telephone number categories are, including the trunk access code:

06: mobile telephone operators,
0800: free service numbers,
084, 085: used for VoIP
087: voicemail and virtual private numbers
088: large companies with more than one address
0970: machine to machine communication, numbers are 8-11 digits long
0979: machine to machine communication, numbers have no fixed length and are reserved for network internal usage
0900: paid information services
0906: adult lines
0909: entertainment
Toll-free numbers (0800) can always be dialled for free, even from (public) payphones; other numbers starting with 08 are not free.

Public resources[edit]
The emergency number is 112. GSM mobile phones may accept different numbers, such as 999, 000 or 911, depending on the firmware. Additionally, calls to 911 are forwarded to 112 (in the Caribbean Netherlands, this is reversed - 112 redirects to 911 in that case).
Directory assistance is available from several commercial providers, on 18xx (e.g., 1888 from KPN).

Caribbean Netherlands[edit]
Main article: Telephone numbers in Curaçao and the Caribbean Netherlands
The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, which form the Caribbean Netherlands after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, retained the numbering plan of the Netherlands Antilles using country code +599, followed by 7, 3 or 4 for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba, respectively. Calls between the European Netherlands and Caribbean Netherlands are billed as international calls.[2]

Telephone numbers in the Philippines follow an open telephone numbering plan and an open dial plan. Both plans are regulated by the National Telecommunications Commission, an attached agency under the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).
The Philippines is assigned an international dialing code of +63 by ITU-T. Telephone numbers are fixed at eight digits for area code 02, and seven digits for area codes from 03X to 09X, with area codes fixed at one, two, or three digits (a six-digit system was used until the mid-1990s; four to five digits were used in the countryside). Mobile phone numbers are always 10 digits (three digits for the service provider, plus a seven-digit number).
When making long-distance calls in the Philippines, the prefix 0 for domestic calls and 00 for international calls are used.


Fixed-line area codes[edit]
Philippine area codes for fixed-line or landline telephones are fixed at two digits, excluding Metro Manila, the province of Rizal and the cities of Bacoor in Cavite and San Pedro in Laguna, which use the area code 2. Some smaller carriers concentrated within a specific geographic area may issue four- or five-digit area codes, but these are being phased out in favor of the standard two-digit area codes.
Occasionally, a particular area may change area codes. For example, the City of Bacoor in Cavite has been included in the geographical coverage area of area code 2 per the National Telecommunications Commission's Memorandum Order No. 08-09-2011, although almost all fixed-lines in the city still use the old 46 area code due to the poor compliance of PLDT and Globe to the said memorandum order. PLDT's response to the memorandum order is the release of its "Call All Manila SIM", an exclusive wireless landline service for Bacoor residents, however, the Barangay Molino VII (Sitio Gawaran) and Sitio Malipay in Molino IV now use area code 2.
Sometimes area codes are shared by several local government entities to maximize their use. Some area codes are shared by multiple provinces, as is the case for former sub-provinces like Guimaras and Iloilo; newly carved provinces like Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Sur; or provinces with small populations like Marinduque and Quezon. In extreme cases, area codes are shared across an island like in Leyte and Samar, or even entire regions, such as with the Cordillera Administrative Region. To identify the call's point of origin, the three-digit telephone exchange prefix is checked.
Since the Philippines employs an open dial plan, telephone numbers dialed within a given area code do not require the area code, excluding calls made from mobile phones or payphones. When dialing other area codes, the domestic long-distance access prefix 0 is added, but when dialing from overseas, the domestic prefix is not included. As such, a typical telephone number in Metro Manila and Rizal would look like this:

Within Metro Manila, Rizal, and cities of Bacoor and San Pedro: 8123-4567
Outside Metro Manila, Rizal, and cities of Bacoor and San Pedro: 02-8123-4567
Overseas calls: +63-2-8123-4567
Since October 6, 2019, all telephone numbers under area 2 had been migrated to eight digits as mandated by the National Telecommunications Commission per Memorandum Order No. 10-10-2017 to address the insufficient number of assignable local exchange codes.
The maintenance for the migration from the usual 7-digit number (XXX-YYYY) to 8-digit (PXXX-YYYY) is from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM.
It lasted five hours of disconnection on telephones and it will also affect subscription-based virtual telephone numbers (i.e. Globe Duo), SIM card-based Telephone Service (i.e. PLDT Landline Plus Prepaid), #MyNumber (The format is #XXXXX, i.e. #87000 for Jollibee Delivery), FEX Lines, SIP Trunks, ISDN and Vanity Numbers, Including virtual numbers like short-digit numbers (i.e. *1888, which is the PLDT Telephone Support, and 211, which is the Talk2Globe or the Globe Prepaid Help and Support), Toll Free (domestic, international and universal, i.e. 1-800-1-123-4567, in dialing, 00-800-1-123-4567) and Premium numbers such as embassy hotline and 1900 service hotline.[1]
Since October 6, 2019, 5:00 AM, the following telephone number format to be followed:

PXXX-YYYY where P is for Public Telecommunication Entity, and the XXX-YYYY is the telephone number.
NTC has assigned the following Public Telecommunications Entity (PTE) identifiers:[2][3]

3XXX–YYYY: Bayan Telecommunications
5XXX–YYYY: Eastern Communications Philippines
6XXX–YYYY: ABS-CBN Convergence
7XXX–YYYY: Globe Telecom
8XXX–YYYY: PLDT

Mobile phone area codes[edit]
Mobile area codes are three digits long and always start with the number 9, although new area codes have been issued with 8 as the starting digit, particularly for VOIP phone numbers. However, the area code indicates the service provider and not necessarily a geographic region. Unlike fixed-line telephones, the long-distance telephone dialing format is always observed when using a mobile phone. Therefore, mobile phone numbers always have the format "+63 966 164-5400" for international callers and "0 966 164-5400" for domestic callers.[citation needed]
Some of the first area codes to be assigned for mobile phones were 912 for Mobiline/Piltel, 915 for Islacom, 917 for Globe Telecom, 918 for Smart Communications, and 973 for Express Telecom. As service began growing rapidly since the 1990s, new codes have been added to meet demand as existing codes have since been exhausted. Newer codes often come immediately after the last code is exhausted, but this might not be the case if the next code is already in use. Starting October 21, 2020, Sun's prepaid service was merged and rebranded into Smart Prepaid, leaving its postpaid service under "Sun" branding.[4] Beginning March 2021, Dito Telecommunity launched new mobile number prefixes, 895, 896, 897, 898, 991, 992, 993 and 994 assigned to Dito Prepaid, Dito Postpaid and Dito WiFi Prepaid.[citation needed]
On April 11, 2022, PLDT and Smart announced that Sun's postpaid service would be merged with Smart Postpaid, resulting to the subsequent forced retirement of all Sun Postpaid plans and add-ons effective April 25, 2022. Smart encouraged those planning to subscribe to Sun to instead take advantage of Smart Signature plans, while existing subscribers can either still use their current subscription plans or upgrade to Smart Signature. With the planned integration of Sun Postpaid to Smart, the Sun Cellular brand will cease to exist in favor of the Smart brand.[citation needed]
In May 2023, Globe Telecom the mobile number prefixes is still unchanged, with 954 assigned to Globe At Home Prepaid WiFi, 953 assigned to TM, and 976 assigned to GOMO!. That same month, Smart Communications launched new mobile number prefix, with 962 assigned to Smart (Prepaid, Postpaid and Bro Prepaid), while the mobile number prefixes is still unchanged with, 981 and 985 assigned to TNT and 964 assigned to Smart Bro Home WiFi Prepaid (formerly PLDT Home Wifi Prepaid).[citation needed]
Area codes are grouped by the provider with no single contiguous block of codes for a single provider. The companies and their respective area codes are listed below:[citation needed]

Telephone numbers in IrelandLocation of Ireland (dark green)LocationCountryIrelandContinentEuropeRegulatorComRegTypeOpenNSN  length7–9Format0xx xxx xxxxAccess codesCountry code+353International access00Long-distance0List of Ireland dialing codes
Numbers on the Irish telephone numbering plan are regulated and assigned to operators by ComReg.


Overview[edit]
Telephone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan that allows variations in number length. The Irish format is similar to systems used in many parts of Europe, notably the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Belgium and France, where geographical numbers are organised using a logic of large regional prefixes, which are then further subdivided into smaller regions. It differs from UK numbering, which originated as alphanumeric codes based on town names.
Irish Mobile and non–geographic numbers are fixed length and do not support local dialling.
The trunk prefix 0 is used to access numbers outside the local area and for all mobile calls. This is followed by an area code, referred to as a National Dialling Code (NDC), the first digit of which indicates the geographical area or type of service (e.g. mobile).
Calls made from mobile phones and some VoIP systems always require the full area code and phone number.
In common with most European countries, the trunk prefix 0 must be omitted when calling Irish numbers from abroad.

General structure of Irish numbering[edit]
Irish area codes vary in length, between one and three digits (excluding the leading 0), and subscribers' numbers are between five and seven digits.
As optional local dialling is facilitated, Irish geographic numbers cannot begin with 0 (trunk prefix), 1 (special number prefix) or 999 (emergency services). However, mobile numbers use the full range of digits, as local dialling is not supported on mobile networks, and the area code must always be dialled.
A migration to a standard format, 0xx xxx xxxx, is in progress; however, to avoid disruption, this process is only being carried out as needed, where existing area codes and local numbering systems have reached full capacity. There is currently no plan to move to a closed numbering system.

Number formats[edit]
Irish geographic numbers vary in length from area to area, but follow standard formats within each area code.
The area code, or prefix, is normally separated by a space, or less commonly, may be displayed in parentheses (brackets). Numbers are usually grouped into easy to read clusters, separated by spaces or hyphens for ease of use.
The use of spaces is recommended by ComReg for ease of compatibility with online services, such as linking to a phone number in a mobile browser, copying and pasting into mobile diallers etc
Other characters, such as / or . are not used as separators.
Area codes / prefixes are always separated from the subscriber number. Merging or reformatting these tends to cause confusion or make numbers look unfamiliar.
While formats vary, numbers are usually printed (e.g. in telephone directories) as follows:
Geographic:

01 XXX XXXX – Dublin area
0XX XXX XXXX – All other 7-digit areas
0XX XXX XXX – 6-digit areas
0XX XXXXX – 5-digit areas
0X0X XXXXX – 5-digit areas
Non-geographic

1800 XXX XXX – Freephone/Toll Free
0818 XXX XXX – Standard Rate
Mobile

08X XXX XXXX
Mobile M2M (Machine to Machine)

088 XXXXX XXXXX
Alphanumeric dialling, using letters as mnemonics for advertising etc is supported, but is rarely used.

Geographical numbering[edit]
Main article: List of Irish dialling codes
Irish geographical numbering is structured on a regional basis and follows a logical hierarchy.
These directory areas correspond approximately to the following geographical regions:

01 – Greater Dublin Area
02 – Cork
04 – Northeast
05 – Southeast
06 – Midwest and Southwest
07 – Northwest
09 – West
The Midlands is covered by several regional codes.
Except for the 01 area, each area is further subdivided into smaller areas (NDCs). Usually, the main city or town in the area is 0x1 e.g. 021 (Cork), 061 (Limerick), 091 (Galway).

Mobile services[edit]
Mobile phone numbers start with the prefix 08x and are part of a closed numbering plan, which means that a mobile phone number must have 10 digits. Calls to landlines and other mobiles require the area code on a mobile phone.
New numbers are assigned on prefixes and ranges managed by a specific operator. However, as full mobile number portability has been in operation since 2003, it is no longer possible to reliably identify which network a particular number is on. For example, a newly assigned Three number would begin with 083, but may have been ported to another operator in the meantime.

M2M (Machine to Machine) Communication[edit]


NDC

Network

Notes


088

All networks
Reserved for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, using the format 088 xxxxx xxxxx. This prefix was originally used for the Eircell TACS network active from 1985 to 2001.

Direct to voicemail number[edit]
Mobile phone numbers also have their own voicemail number. To access this, the number 5 should be put after the prefix. For example, the mobile number 08x xxx xxxx has the voicemail number 08x 5 xxx xxxx.
On some networks, when the direct to voicemail number is called, the voicemail greeting for that network is played (e.g. Vodafone, eir Mobile), while others request a phone number followed by the voicemail greeting for that number (e.g. Three). Users can press the hash key (#) to gain access to the voicemail box.

Calls to Northern Ireland[edit]
Although Northern Ireland is part of the UK numbering plan, a special arrangement exists for calling Northern Irish landlines from the Republic of Ireland.
Calls to Northern Ireland can be dialled using the 048 prefix or by dialling the number in the full international format. Most Irish operators treat calls to Northern Ireland at national or even local rates. Similar charging arrangements apply when calling the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland.
For example, to reach Belfast landline 90xx xxxx, subscribers can dial either 048 90xx xxxx or 00 44 28 90xx xxxx.
Northern Ireland mobile phones use the same mobile numbering and networks as other parts of the UK – calls must be dialled using the 00 44 7xxx xxx xxx format.

International calls[edit]
In common with all EU countries, the international access code is 00.
Numbers should be dialled as follows: 00 – country code – area code – local number.
All mobile phones and some VoIP services also support the international E.164 number format, so a + may be optionally used instead of 00.

Reserved numbers[edit]
03 – reserved for future changes in the numbering plan
07 – all except 0707, 0700, 071, 074 and 076 are reserved without assigned purpose
0707 – reserved for personal numbering
0800 – reserved
Special numbers[edit]
00 – international access
020 91x xxxx – drama use (although the rest of 020 is free)
0700 – personal numbering
076 – VoIP services – (being withdrawn.)
080 – mailbox for landline users (formerly access code for Northern Ireland)
089 011 0xxx[1] – drama use
Speed dial short numbers to contact carriers[edit]
1901 – eir
1902 – Digiweb
1903 – Tesco Mobile
1904 – BT Ireland
1907 – Vodafone Ireland
1908 – Virgin Mobile Ireland
1913 – Three Ireland
1910 – Magnet Networks
1977 – NUACOM Ireland
Operator services[edit]
General operator assistance no longer exists in Ireland.

118xx – Directory enquiries (multiple commercial providers offer a variety of services in this number range)
Emergency services[edit]
The emergency number for Ireland is 999. However, the 112 code also accesses the emergency operator. This code is harmonised across the EU. Either can be dialled.

Services provided[edit]
Ambulance
Garda Síochána
Fire and rescue
Irish Coast Guard
Cliff and mountain rescue
SMS emergency service[edit]
112 can also be contacted by SMS. While the service is open to all users, it is primarily aimed at the deaf community.
Pre-registration used to be required. Further information can be found at [1].

Premium rate numbers[edit]
Premium rate voice[edit]
Irish premium rate telephone numbers start with 15 and are read in two-digit blocks e.g. 1550 is "fifteen fifty".
The rates given below are from ComReg and are indicative only. One must check with their specific telephone service provider for exact rates.

Premium rate services in Ireland are regulated by ComReg.[2]

Non–geographic numbers (Freephone & Standard rate)[edit]
Irish non-geographic numbers consist of two national prefixes and the international freephone service.

0818 – Charged as landline call, and are included in bundled minutes. 6-digit numbers in the format 0818 XXX XXX
1800 – Freephone / toll free (from all Irish mobile and landlines. 6-digit numbers in the format 1800 xxx xxx
00 800 – Freephone / toll free (from all Irish mobile and landlines. 8-digit numbers in the format 00 800 xxxx xxxx
Where high volume 'bursty traffic' is anticipated, such as on-air radio competition lines, the first two digits of the phone number are always 71. For example:
1800 71x xxx or 0818 71x xxx. This allows the telephone network to manage traffic during number analysis, even before the call is routed.
Ireland's non-geographic numbers and pricing structures were simplified and old shared-cost prefixes were withdrawn on 1 January 2022.
These changes mean that calls to non-geographic numbers are either freephone, or always included in call bundles, ensuring consumers are not confused by out of bundle, or other unusual charges.

00800
Free
International freephone / toll free
Free on all voice services in Ireland. Can be dialled as +800 in many countries.


Due to the COVID-19 crisis, several numbers in the 1850 and 1890 ranges will remain in service until 2023. This is to avoid disruption to essential health services during a time of high volumes of calls. These will remain in service until 30 November 2023, alongside new numbers that have replaced them. Advertising of these numbers will cease. Calls to these numbers will be charged on the same basis as calls to landlines or 0818 and included in call bundles.[3]
Freephone numbers are free to call from mobile handsets; however, the recipient can elect to refuse mobile–originated calls or choose to accept calls only from predefined geographical region(s).
NB: 1800 can only be dialled from within Ireland. Numbers should never be printed or presented in the international format +353 1800 as these clash with working Dublin landline numbers in the 01 area +353 1 800 xxxx. Alternative geographic numbers, or an 0818 number should be used instead, if international access is required.
Following a 2019 review[4] of non–geographic numbers Comreg decided to withdraw and close the 1850, 1890 and 076 number ranges by 1 January 2022. During the transition period, these ranges were geo–rated (charged as if they are geographical numbers).
From August 2019, various telecoms providers announced price changes which took effect on, or just before, 1 December 2019, including Virgin Media Business, in2tel, Virgin Media, eir, Tesco Mobile, Three, Digiweb, Pure Telecom, 48 months and Sky.
From 1 January 2022 callers to the withdrawn prefixes receive recorded announcements.

Internet access numbers[edit]
1891 – reduced cost internet access (possibly timed)
1892 – local rate internet access (timed)
1893 – variable cost internet access (timed)
Carrier selection (per call)[edit]
13xxx – carrier selection (third party long distance, international and internet services). These codes override the default carrier.
Carrier preselect is normally used where the exchange automatically uses the customer's preferred provider(s).

Network engineering codes[edit]
199xxx... – network operator-specific engineering codes (undefined length). These codes are generally not published.
Line information codes[edit]
These services give the user more information about their phone line (applicable only to lines provided using the OpenEir access network.)

Check phone number associated with line / automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC)[edit]
199000 – reads out the subscriber's telephone number.
Check preset carrier[edit]
Check which carrier a subscriber is using for each category of call:

19800 – international calls
19822 – local calls
19801 – calls to other parts of the Republic of Ireland, Irish mobile numbers and landlines in Northern Ireland.
Voicemail[edit]
171 – used to access voicemail on all networks: fixed line (POTS and Cable), all mobile operators and many VoIP providers.
Call management services / supplementary service codes[edit]
Special short codes are used to control various supplementary services offered by digital local exchanges. These services were first introduced as PhonePlus in 1981, on the first generation of Alcatel E10 and Ericsson AXE digital exchanges used in Ireland, and were rolled out nationally throughout the 1980s.
These services are available on all Irish PSTN lines, regardless of operator. There is a more expansive range of services available, but these are the most commonly used. Different codes apply on cable telephony lines, such as those provided by Virgin Media Ireland and on VoIP providers.

PSTN lines and some ISDN services[edit]
Caller ID services[edit]
141 – caller ID default override – withhold caller ID on this call
142 – caller ID default override – present caller ID on this call
1471  – check last missed call. The system will verbally announce details of the last missed call
#93# – delete missed call information from network memory
Call waiting[edit]
*43# – setup
*#43# – check status
#43# – cancel
Answering call waiting[edit]
R0 – reject call (or send to voicemail) and temporarily suspend call waiting service for this call.
R1 – answer waiting call and disconnect current call.
R2 – answer waiting call and place current call on hold/or swap between calls.
R3 – merge both calls into a three–way call.
Conference/three–way calling[edit]
While on a phone call a subscriber can press the R key on their phone and dial the number they wish to add to the conversation.
Dial R3 to begin conference/three–way call.
R2 allows a subscriber to separate the calls and swap between them.
Call hold / transfer to another extension[edit]
R – places call on hold. Hang up and telephone will ring until call on hold is picked up again.
Call forwarding (unconditional)[edit]
*21*(phone number)# – forward all calls to (phone number)
*#21# – check status
#21# – deactivate
When this service is active, the dial tone changes to a two–frequency 'siren' tone.

Alarm / reminder call[edit]
*55*[time in 4–digit 24h format]# e.g. for 8:30 am dial *55*0830#
*#55# – check status
#55# – cancel
Most exchanges confirm setup with a verbal announcement; however, some exchanges may use a ringing tone to indicate successful service setup and a busy tone to indicate an error/invalid code.

Services on Virgin Media Ireland cable network[edit]
(Codes are unique to Virgin Media Ireland and do not follow ETSI guidelines)

Caller ID services[edit]
141 – caller ID default override – withhold caller ID on this call
142 – caller ID default override – present caller ID on this call

Mobiles[edit]
GSM supplementary service codes – All of Ireland's mobile providers use the standard GSM codes to control special services such as call forwarding, barring, call waiting etc.
Number changes[edit]
Several major number changes have occurred since 1990. The telephone number changes in Dublin and Cork took several years to complete, as they were busier area codes with few available lead digits. 
Other number changes took place in just one step, with all numbers being changed simultaneously.
To minimise disruption simultaneous working was enabled, allowing old numbers to remain mapped and active for a run-in period of one year. Caller ID only displayed the new numbers. This was followed by recorded announcements which remained active for at least a year, advising callers of the number change. Eventually this would be replaced by a dialling error message.

1990–1994[edit]
Dublin (01) changes to 7-digits.

All local numbers with the area code 01 changed from 6–digits to 7–digits in five stages between 1990 and 1994:
On 2 April 1990, numbers beginning with 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 70 and 79 were prefixed with 6.
On 8 April 1991, numbers beginning with 8 and 69 were prefixed with 2.

Possible future changes[edit]
All local numbers with the area code 01 are currently 7–digits, but may change to 8–digits in the future, although breaking the city into separate area codes would match the rest of the national system.
A review and public consultation on the future of Ireland's numbering plan was undertaken.[5]

Historical numbering[edit]
Defunct non-geographic codes[edit]
1850 – Local rate, shared cost, untimed
1890 – Local rate, shared cost, timed

All of the above were withdrawn on 1 January 2022.

Defunct access codes[edit]
16  – former international access code[6]
03 – formerly used for calls to Great Britain. The format was 03 + NDC code + local number.[7]
08 – formerly used for Northern Ireland landlines
084 – formerly used for Belfast landlines[8]
Defunct operator services[edit]
10 – national operator assistance (withdrawn in 2007)

910 – operator-assisted calls to some areas without direct dialling (withdrawn in the early 1980s)
1190 – Telecom Éireann national directory assistance (withdrawn in the early 2000s and replaced with 11811, originally 190)
1197 – Telecom Éireann UK directory assistance (withdrawn in the early 2000s and replaced with 11818, originally 197)
1198 – Telecom Éireann international directory assistance (withdrawn in the early 2000s and replaced with 11818, originally 198)

Defunct information services[edit]
1191 – speaking clock (withdrawn on 27 August 2018)
Historical Northern Ireland access codes[edit]
before 2000: 08 followed by Northern Irish area code and phone number e.g. Belfast 01232 xxx xxx was reached by dialling 08 01232 xxx xxx.
Belfast could previously be reached by dialling 084 in place of the UK area code 0232.[8]

Historical Great Britain access codes[edit]
Until the early 1990s, the 03 numbering range was originally used for calls to Great Britain,[9] including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, with the Irish prefix 030 replacing the UK trunk code 0.[7][10]
Calls to British cities using the director telephone system were also possible using shorter codes:

031 – London (01)[11]
032 – Birmingham (021)[12]
033 – Edinburgh (031)[12]
034 – Glasgow (041)[12]
035 – Liverpool (051)[12]
036 – Manchester (061)[12]
031 was replaced with 03071[13] and 03081[14] when 01 was split into the area codes 071 and 081 in 1990.
Use of 03 for this purpose was discontinued in 1993, when the international access code changed from 16 to 00, with calls to Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) requiring the country code +44 and the area code in full.[15]

The country calling code +970 is reserved for telephone numbers in the State of Palestine.
This code is mainly used when calling from Arab countries to places under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority (including the Gaza Strip). The telecommunication system in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is considerably dependent on the Israeli infrastructure, therefore, from most countries, dialing +972 would often be the better option to access phone numbers in the Palestinian territories. In some cases, when the number was allocated directly by an Israeli company, this would be the only option. However, from many Arab or Muslim countries that block the Israeli access code, dialing 970 is the only option to access the Palestinian telecommunication system. Syria is currently the only country that blocks both 972 and 970 access codes. Lebanon lifted the ban on the 970 code in July 2008 but still blocks the 972 code.[1]
Palestinians use the Israeli telecommunication infrastructure either directly or through the Palestinian Paltel company, which allocates numbers reserved for it by the Israeli Ministry of Communications.
The 059 prefix is reserved exclusively for the Palestinian Jawwal cellular communication company (a subsidiary of Paltel), and the 056 prefix is similarly reserved for the Wataniya Telecom company. Note that these prefixes had been used in the past as Israeli internal dialing prefixes, but were replaced or merged with other dialing codes, and reintroduced for the exclusive use of the Palestinian telecommunication system.

In the United Kingdom, telephone numbers are administered by the Office of Communications (Ofcom). For this purpose, Ofcom established a telephone numbering plan, known as the National Telephone Numbering Plan, which is the system for assigning telephone numbers to subscriber stations.
Telephone numbers are of variable length. Local numbers are supported from landlines. Numbers can be dialled with a '0'-lead prefix that denotes either a geographical region or another service. Mobile phone numbers have distinct prefixes that are not geographic, and are portable between providers.


Structure[edit]
All mobile numbers, nearly all geographic numbers, and nearly all non-geographic numbers have ten national (significant) digits after the trunk code 0. The overall structure of the UK's National Numbering Plan is:[1]



Prefix

Service type


00

01

Geographic area codes


02

Geographic area codes (introduced in 2000).


03

Non-geographic numbers charged at standard geographic area code rates (introduced in 2007)


04

05

08

Toll-free services (080x), special-rate services (084x and 087x)


09

Premium-rate services

In the United Kingdom, the "area code" is often referred to as a "subscriber trunk dialling code"  (STD code) or a "dialling code".
STD codes are two, three, four or, exceptionally, five digits long (after the initial zero). Regions with shorter area codes, typically large cities, permit the allocation of more telephone numbers as the local number part has more digits. Local customer numbers are four to eight digits long. The total number of digits is ten or, very rarely, nine. 
The code allocated to the largest population is (020) for London. The code allocated to the largest area is (028) for all of Northern Ireland. The UK Numbering Plan also applies to three British Crown dependencies – Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man – even though they are not part of the UK.

Number ranges starting 01 can have National Significant Number (NSN) length of 10 or (very rarely) 9 digits. NSN is the number of digits after the leading 0 trunk code or +44 international prefix. The 0800 range can have NSN length as 10, 9, or 7 digits. The 0845 range can have NSN length as 10 or 7 digits. The 0500 range had NSN length as 9 digits only, and was withdrawn from use on 3 June 2017. All other UK numbers have NSN length of 10 digits. There are no telephone numbers in the UK with an NSN length of 8 digits.

Geographic numbers[edit]
Main article: List of dialling codes in the United Kingdom
Standard geographic numbers[edit]
Geographic telephone numbers in the UK always have nine or ten digits after the 0 trunk code or +44 international dialling prefix.

Four-digit area codes[edit]
Four-digit area codes have either six-digit subscriber numbers or a mix of five- and six-digit subscriber numbers.

(01xxx) xxx xxx
This is the format used by most areas. It has a four-digit area code (after the initial zero) and a six digit subscriber number, and is known as 4+6 format. These area codes were changed by adding a "1" directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995. Just short of 581 areas use this format, and the area codes range from 01200 to 01998. Almost all (01xxx) area codes now have only six digit subscriber numbers, but a small number of these areas also have some subscriber numbers only five digits in length (see next section).

Six of the four-digit area codes are known as "mixed" areas as they share those four digits with the twelve five-digit area codes. This leads to a restriction as to which initial digits can be used for subscriber numbers within those four-digit area codes, e.g. in the 01387 four-digit area code, subscriber numbers cannot begin with a 3 because 013873 is a separate five-digit area code; likewise in the 01946 four-digit area code, subscriber numbers cannot begin with a 7 because 019467 is a separate five-digit area code.

(01xxx) xx xxx
This is used for forty smaller towns which have a mixture of six and five digit local numbers, each type allocated in specific DE blocks*; e.g. in the 01647 area code numbers beginning 24 and 61 have five digits (24xxx and 61xxx; known as 4+5 format) whereas all other DE blocks* within that area code have six digit numbers. The number of places with five digit subscriber numbers and an 01xxx area code has declined rapidly in recent decades. There were 511 ranges allocated across 56 different area codes in January 1998. The Big Number Change removed many, especially in Northern Ireland, and by July 2005 there were only 329 ranges in 42 codes. By April 2010 this had reduced to 324 ranges in 40 codes, with still the same number in November 2012. The 40 area codes are listed in the table below.
*A DE block is a block of numbers where (taking the area code and the subscriber number together) the initial 0 and the next six digits after it are the same for all the subscriber numbers in the block.
(These area codes, like many others, were changed by adding a "1" directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.)

Three-digit area codes[edit]
Three-digit area codes always have seven-digit subscriber numbers and always begin 011x or 01x1.

(01x1) xxx xxxx
This is the geographic number format for the first round of five large cities moved to all figure dialling in the 1960s, and subsequently also used in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, eastern County Durham and south-eastern Northumberland from the 1980s onwards. These six areas have a three-digit area code matching the pattern 1x1 (after the initial zero) and a seven digit subscriber number, and this is known as 3+7 format. These area codes were changed by adding a "1" directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.

(011x) xxx xxxx
This is the geographic number format for the second round of large cities and towns moved to brand-new three-digit area codes. Five of these were moved in 1995 as a part of PhONEday, with Reading then following a year later. At the time of the change, an extra digit was added to the subscriber number. These six areas have a three-digit area code matching the pattern 11x, with a seven-digit subscriber number, and this is known as 3+7 format. The first three digits of the local number identifies a small area within the town or city. The former Reading area code had already been changed once, by adding a "1" directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.

Two-digit area codes[edit]
Two-digit area codes always have eight-digit subscriber numbers and always begin 02.

(02x) xxxx xxxx
This is the newest geographic number format. It is used for the third tier of large cities and for Northern Ireland, and was formed as a part of the Big Number Change in 2000. The new area code is much shorter than the old one, and begins 02 unlike the previous 01 area codes. Numbers in these five areas are commonly misquoted, e.g. London as 0207 or Cardiff as 02920. The numbers consist of a two-digit area code matching the pattern 02x, and an eight-digit subscriber number, and this is known as 2+8 format.
The first four digits of the local number identifies a small area within the town or city. At the time of the change, the subscriber part of the number gained an extra digit in London, those in Northern Ireland gained two or three digits, and the subscriber part of the number in the other areas gained two digits. All of these areas were also subject to a previous code change, one that added a "1" directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.

Five-digit area codes[edit]
Five-digit area codes have either five-digit subscriber numbers or a mix of four- and five-digit subscriber numbers.
Five-digit area codes always share their first four digits with four-digit area codes.

(01xx xx) xx xxx and (01xx xx) xxxx
This is the oldest geographic number format and is used for twelve smaller towns and villages where the subscriber number is either five or (in one area code) four digits long. These are known as 5+5 and 5+4 format. Therefore, the STD code and the subscriber number does not always total ten digits after the initial zero trunk code. These area codes were changed by adding a "1" directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995. The number of places using these two formats has declined rapidly in recent decades and Brampton is the last place in the UK with four-digit local numbers.

The above twelve area codes and their six 'parent' area codes (01387, 01524, 01539, 01697, 01768 and 01946) are known as 'Mixed' areas due to multiple area codes sharing the same SABC digits (i.e. the initial zero and the following four digits).

National-dialling-only ranges[edit]
These ranges have subscriber numbers beginning with the digits "0" or "1", e.g.:



0169 770 xxxx

Brampton


01332 050 xxx

Derby


01382 006 xxx

Dundee


0141 005 xxxx

Glasgow


0117 101 xxxx

Bristol


0118 00x xxxx

Reading


020 0003 xxxx

London

Currently, these numbers are mostly used as the termination points for non-geographic numbers, and by some automated systems such as alarms. As such they are not usually meant to be directly dialled. Using these numbers directly has been problematic as some mobile phone operators in the UK do not allow access to these ranges,[9] and there may also be difficulty accessing these numbers from outside the UK.
Regulator Ofcom proposes that in future these ranges be released for wider, general-purpose use in up to 70 area codes facing number shortage[10] but then, in order to avoid confusion with codes beginning with these digits, the area code would always have to be dialled for all calls, even from within the same geographic exchange. Accordingly, if these numbers are eventually released for general use, Ofcom proposes completely removing the ability to dial locally without the area code in areas affected.
Requiring the use of the area code also allows additional local numbers starting with normally protected Special Services numbers (such as 999, 101, 111, 112 etc.) to be used, significantly increasing the quantity of numbers available for use. This occurred on 1 November 2012 for the 01202 area code, which covers the Bournemouth area.[11]
Recently, the carrier TalkTalk have inadvertently released parts of the 020 0011 range to the general public,[12] with these numbers currently being in use. For example, the charity Give a Car used the number 020 0011 1664 for a while, but recently switched to a proper London number.

Mobile telephones[edit]
07xxx xxx xxx—mobile phones and WiFi numbers.
Individual mobile phone companies are allocated different ranges within the 073xx, 074xx, 075xx, 07624, 077xx, 078xx and 079xx area codes. Changes to mobile phone numbers in the Big Number Change were mostly straight replacements, such as Vodafone customers on the 0378 block became 07778.

Since the advent of Mobile number portability, mobile phone number prefixes can no longer be relied on to determine the current operator of a particular mobile phone – only the original operator.

Pagers and personal numbering[edit]
07x xxxx xxxx—pagers and personal numbering (PNS).


070 xxxx xxxx

Personal numbering


076 xxxx xxxx

Pagers (excluding 07624, used for mobile phones on the Isle of Man)

Personal numbers beginning 070 are regulated by Phone-paid Services Authority.
Calls to 070 and 076 numbers are often charged at a much higher rate than the similar-looking 07xxx mobile telephone numbers and often they are not included in "inclusive minutes" in phone contracts.
From 1 October 2019, Ofcom has capped the termination or wholesale rate for calls to 070 numbers to be at the same level as for calls to mobile numbers. Ofcom "expect[s] this will allow phone companies to price calls to these numbers or include them in call allowances in the same way that they do for calls to mobile [number]s".[13]

Non-geographic numbers[edit]
Main article: Non-geographic telephone numbers in the United Kingdom
Non-geographic numbers charged at geographic rate[edit]
03xx xxx xxxx—"UK-wide" numbering.
03xx is a range of non-geographic numbers introduced in 2007 as a cheaper alternative to the shared-cost non-geographic numbers (such as 0870 or 0845 numbers). In contrast to the 084x/087x range, calls to 03 numbers are considered local calls for billing purposes (i.e., like calls to a geographic number 01 or 02).[14] This means that customers who are benefiting from inclusive minutes on mobile phone or landline calling plans are also able to call these numbers using their inclusive minutes.[15]
There are four different ranges of numbers: those beginning 030x are reserved for qualifying public bodies and non-profit organisations; those beginning 033x can be allocated to anyone; and those beginning 034x and 037x have been allocated for migration from the matching 084x and 087x number ranges respectively.[16]



030x xxx xxxx

For qualifying public bodies and non-profit organisations as defined by Ofcom


033x xxx xxxx

For any end user

Migration range for operators who have 084x numbers


037x xxx xxxx

Corporate and VoIP numbering[edit]
05x xxxx xxxx—Corporate and VoIP numbering.
Unlike 03 numbers there is no uniform pricing for 05 numbers; BT charge a number of different rates depending on the number dialled.[17] Some are charged at geographic rate, others not. Other operators are not required to charge the same rates as BT for calling 05 numbers.



055 xxxx xxxx

Corporate Numbering (but also used by BT for its Broadband Voice service)


056 xxxx xxxx

Freephone numbers[edit]
0500 xxx xxx—Freephone services allocated before 1999.
Until July 2017, the 0500 range was used for some freephone services which were originally provided by Mercury Communications Ltd (now Cable & Wireless Worldwide). These numbers were different from the rest of the 05 range in that they are only 9 digits in length after the 0 trunk code, e.g. 0500 007 007 (National Savings and Investments), 0500 2 88 2 91 (BBC Radio 2, 88 to 91 FM), 0500 600 600 (Crimewatch), 0500 600 700 (Watchdog[clarification needed]) and 0500 909 693 (BBC Radio 5 Live, 909 and 693 kHz). Numerous universities, government departments, airlines, banks and businesses also used these numbers. They were allocated before the general trend of using longer numbers started in 1997 and long before the rest of the 05 range was assigned to corporate and VoIP numbering after 2000.



0500 xxx xxx[notes 2]

Special Services – No charge to Customer a.k.a. "Freephone"

Free to call from landline, up to 40p per minute from mobile.

The range was withdrawn by Ofcom in July 2017[18] as a result of a series of consultations starting from 2012.[19] The number range
08085 xxx xxx was made available to owners of 0500 xxx xxx to enable a smooth transition.

0800 xxx xxx, 0800 xxx xxxx and 0808 xxx xxxx—Freephone services.


0800 xxx xxx[notes 3]

Special Services – No charge to Customer a.k.a. "Freephone"

Free to call from landline, and was up to 40p per minute from mobile, until July 2015 when calls to 080 numbers from mobiles became free. Calls to certain charity and similar services were always free from most mobiles.0808 9xx xxxx numbers are used by freephone internet services.


0800 xxx xxxx


0808 xxx xxxx

There is one short "special" number in this range, 0800 11 11 for Childline.
Additionally, numbers in the range 0808 80x xxxx are reserved for not-for-profit helplines and as such are usually free to call from most mobile telephones. Many other numbers can also be called for free from mobiles,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] but this varies by network.

Fixed-rate or special-rate services[edit]
084x xxx xxxx (Special Services basic rate) – non-geographic fixed-rate or special-rate services
087x xxx xxxx (Special Services higher rate) – non-geographic fixed-rate or special-rate services.
With the exception of 080x freephone numbers, 08xx numbers are charged above geographic rates, with some of the extra revenue going to the terminating telco. This additional revenue may be shared with the subscriber, but is often used instead to subsidise additional network services, such as fax-to-email, virtual office applications, call queuing, voicemail and easy number redirection. None of these call management services is exclusive to 08xx numbers and they could be provided on any number range.
Special Services basic rate range:

Up to 4.26p a minute (plus VAT), but fixed (e.g. always 3p/minute or always 4p/minute) from BT landline, other providers may charge more; up to 42p a minute from mobiles.

There were a few short "special" number in this range, such as 0845 46 47 for NHS Direct; this was closed in 2014 and replaced by NHS 111, except in Wales where the transition took place in 2015.
Special Services higher rate range:

The usage of 0871, 0872 and 0873 numbers is regulated by PhonepayPlus.[28]
There was widespread confusion about the cost of calling 084 and 087 numbers until 2015. They often do not qualify for discounts and bundled minutes, and can be prohibitively expensive when called from mobiles and payphones. Many major companies persist in misdescribing them as "Local Rate", "Lo Call" (often as 'locall rate' which can be easily misread as 'local rate') or "National Rate" for which the Advertising Standards Authority can take action.[29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]

Access charge and service charge[edit]
From 1 July 2015, the charge for calls to 084, 087, 09 and 118 numbers has been simplified. It is split into two parts: An access charge, payable to the telephone service provider – e.g. BT, EE, Sky – plus a service charge paid to the company offering the service.
Companies with 084, 087, and 09 numbers must declare the service charge element of the call cost when advertising their phone number; for example, a number may be advertised saying "Calls cost 20p per minute plus your phone company's access charge".[43] Telecoms companies must inform their customers about their access charge for calling each number range. The EU Consumer Rights Directive requires that many entities that held 084 and 087 numbers will no longer be allowed to use them. The directive bans the usage of numbers that cost more than calling a geographic number for customer service and complaints lines, and other such purposes.[44][45] Since Britain left the EU the Directive as such no longer applies, but its provisions may have been incorporated into British law.[needs update]

Other 08xx number ranges[edit]
08xx xxx xxxx—Internet for schools and Inbound routing codes.


0820 xxx xxxx

Special Services: Internet for schools


0899 9xx xxxx

Inbound routing codes

Premium rate content services (PRS and SES)[edit]
09xx xxx xxxx—Premium Rate Content Services
Numbers in the 09xx range are charged at the highest rates of any calls within the United Kingdom, and are controlled by various regulations regarding their use. The regulator is the Phone-paid Services Authority, formerly PhonepayPlus.[28] There are a large number of charge bands, some with high pence-per-minute rates, others with a high fixed-price for the entire call.



090x xxx xxxx

Premium rate content services (PRS)


0908 xxx xxxx0909 xxx xxxx

Sexual entertainment services (SES) (not available for new allocations)


091x xxx xxxx

Premium rate non-content services (PRS)


098x xxx xxxx

Sexual entertainment services (SES)

The earlier unused 092x xxx xxxx – 099x xxx xxxx allocation for "Broadband Internet Services" no longer exists and was removed from the number plan in 2005.

Crown dependencies[edit]
Although calls from UK landlines to landlines in the islands are charged at the same rate as those to other UK landlines (i.e. they are not treated as international calls), calls may be excluded from calling plans offering unlimited UK fixed-line calls.
Mobile operators may also charge more for calls to the islands and these calls are usually excluded from calling plans. Calls and SMS messages sent to island mobile phone numbers are not charged at the same rate as calls to UK mobile phone numbers.

Fictitious numbers[edit]
Ofcom has also reserved certain number ranges for use in media productions, such as radio and television dramas and films; so as to avoid the risk of people having genuine telephone numbers displayed and receiving unwanted calls.  This is similar to the use of fictitious telephone numbers in other countries.
In most of the large cities with three-digit area codes, a range of numbers is reserved, usually all the numbers starting with the digits 496.  For fictitious numbers in other areas not using three-digit area codes, the area code 01632 is reserved; this code is not in use, although 0632 was previously used for Newcastle upon Tyne until the late 1980s (63 = NE), and briefly reallocated for use by premium rate services in the 1990s.  There are also reserved ranges for fictitious mobile, freephone, and premium rate numbers.[47][48]
The Post Office even produced dial centre labels for use in advertisements and film / TV with a mythical exchange called VINcent plus four digits.  The numerical equivalent of VIN was 846, and all the caller got was the speaking clock (i.e. 846 is also numerical equivalent of TIM) in the big city 'Director' areas.[49]
At around the same time as the other Big Number Change changes, Ofcom revised their recommendations to update the prefixes, add additional areas and increase the size of the allocation from 10 to 1,000 numbers per block.  Those changes are listed in the Big Number Change article.
In Coronation Street, the fictional Manchester suburb of Weatherfield uses the unallocated range 0161 715 xxxx.[50]
Mobile numbers beginning with 07700 are frequently seen in TV dramas.  These numbers have been specifically set aside for TV and radio dramas.

Special service numbers[edit]
Emergency services and helplines[edit]
The UK has two free emergency numbers: the traditional 999, which is still widely used, and the EU standard 112. Both 999 and 112 are used to contact all emergency services: Police, Fire Service, Ambulance Service and Coastguard. (Standard advice for Mountain Rescue or Cave Rescue is to ask the emergency operator for the police, who oversee the communication with these two services.[51][52][53])
Both numbers can be called from mobile phones with the keylock on or without entering the PIN where that would otherwise be required. Although some mobile phones allow emergency calls to be attempted without a SIM card, at present the UK networks reject such calls. Since November 2009, an emergency call can be made through any UK mobile network as long as there is a SIM for any valid UK network in the handset. Although UK VOIP phone providers are required to offer 999 / 112 service, this is subject to a registration for the service and with a verified service address and users need to be aware such service may not work in a power blackout; however, International VOIP providers may not provide this service.
The chargeable number 101 was introduced for non-urgent crime and community safety calls on a trial basis in 2006. In Wales, the scheme was taken forward by all four police forces, who adopted the number for non-emergency calls on a permanent basis in early 2009. In England, the scheme was on trial until 2012, when it was adopted nationwide and the cost to call changed from 10p per call to 15p per call. In Northern Ireland, the number was introduced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in March 2014.[54] Since 1 April 2020 the number is free to call.
The operator is obtained via 100 from landlines, while directory enquiries, formerly 192, is now provided in the 118xxx range, (not to be confused with 0118, the area code for Reading.) e.g. 118 212, 118 800, 118 500, 118 118, by different companies. International operator assistance is reached through 155.
From early 2010, the pan-European 116 number range came into use for social helplines. The first three numbers allocated were Missing People using 116 000 for a missing children helpline, the NSPCC ChildLine on 116 111, and Samaritans using 116 123 for an emotional support helpline.[citation needed] A recent[when?] consultation for the numbers 116 106 and 116 117 has yet to see any result.
The National Health Service (NHS) can be reached on 111 for non-emergency calls (from landlines and mobiles only). In other European countries, the number 116 117 is used for a similar purpose.
The NHS has also launched a COVID-19 helpline on 119 relating to swabbing so these calls do not go through the 111 call centre.
Local electricity network operators can be reached on 105 to report power cuts.[55]
Two telephone helplines within the regular code space have only eight digits, namely 0800 11 11 for ChildLine and 0845 4647 for NHS Direct in Wales.
The number 159 ('Call 159') has been introduced to give a standard number for calling banks, in an effort to reduce scams where people are tricked into calling someone pretending to be their bank.[56]

Speaking clock[edit]
Since the mid-1990s, speaking clock services have been available throughout Great Britain using the number 123. Before this, exchanges in "Director" areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) dialled 846 (TIM), later changing to 123; main exchanges in "non-Director" areas originally used "952", later changing to "80" with the introduction of STD and eventually to "8081" as other recorded services were introduced on 80X1 codes. Some mobile operators allocate other services to 123, such as customer services or voicemail.

Automated services and access codes[edit]
Short codes beginning with 1 are reserved for telecom service providers' own functionality; some of the most well-known are codes for use with Caller Display:



141

Withhold number
when normally released


1470

Release number
when normally withheld


1471

Last call information and return
caller may press 3 to return call on most networks


1475

1471 erasure
removes details of last call from 1471 service.  May need to be prefixed with 1470 if number is normally withheld


1477

Automatic Call Trace

Stores number (even if withheld) of nuisance caller at terminating exchange for subsequent investigation and enforcement,
but service is seldom enabled by default



1571

Voicemail service
For people who do not have answering machines.If there is a new message, the dial tone will be stuttered.


1572

BT Call Protect
To divert nuisance calls to junk voicemail.


#31#

Withhold number

141 equivalent for use on mobile networks

Many fixed-line telephone subscribers, e.g. of BT,[57] Virgin Media,[58] SkyTalk, TalkTalk, and PlusNet, have the opportunity to use an automated messaging service which takes messages when the called number is either engaged ("busy") or not answered within a given time. This can be accessed by calling 1571.
For fixed-line users, it is possible to override the carrier pre-selection (CPS) on a per-call basis, dialling a special code before the number, e.g. 1280 for BT, 1664 for LowerCall, or 1844 for Daisy. Ofcom defines the range for these as: "124 to 140, 143 to 146, 148 to 149, 160 to 169, and 181 to 189, inclusive. Numbers of up to 5 digits used to access an Indirect Access Provider ('Type B Access Codes')".[59]

(Redirected from +800)
Type of telephone number where the subscriber thereof is billed instead of the calling party
A toll-free telephone number or freephone number is a telephone number that is billed for all arriving calls. For the calling party, a call to a toll-free number from a landline is free of charge. A toll-free number is identified by a dialing prefix similar to an area code. The specific service access varies by country.


History[edit]
The features of toll-free services have evolved as telephone networks have evolved from electro-mechanical call switching to computerized stored program controlled networks.[1]
Originally,[when?] a call billed to the called party had to be placed through a telephone company operator as a collect call, often long-distance. The operator had to secure acceptance of the charges at the remote number, or even transfer that decision to a long-distance operator, before manually completing the call.
Some large businesses and government offices received large numbers of collect calls, which proved time-consuming for operators and the callers.

Manual toll-free systems[edit]
Prior to the development of customer-dialed toll-free service many telephone companies provided the service by operator assistance for telephone subscribers without dial telephones (manual service).
Operator-assisted toll-free calling included the Zenith number service introduced in the 1930s in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the manual 'Freephone' service introduced by the British Post Office in 1960.[2][3]
Both systems were similar in concept. The calling party would ring the operator (now '100' in the UK, '0' in Canada/U.S.) and ask for a specific free number. In the U.S., the caller would ask for a number like "Zenith 12345" (some areas used "Enterprise" or "WX" instead of "Zenith").[4] In the UK, the caller would ask the operator to ring "Freephone" and a name or number (such as "Freephone Crimebusters" to pass on tips about a crime to the constabulary).[5]
In either case, the operator would look up the corresponding geographic number from a list and place the call with charges reversed.
A Zenith number was typically available from a predefined area, anything from a few nearby cities to a province or state, and was listed in local directories in each community from which the subscriber was willing to accept the charges for inbound calls.
Until the introduction of InWATS toll-free service by the Bell System on May 2, 1967 and the Linkline (later "Freefone") 0800 services by British Telecom on 12 November 1985, manually ringing the operator was the standard means to place a toll-free call. More than a few established manual "Freephone" or "Zenith" numbers remained in use for many years after competing automated systems (0800 in UK, 1‑800 in U.S.) were deployed in parallel for new toll-free numbers.[6]

Initial direct-dial systems[edit]

An automated toll-free service was introduced by AT&T in 1966 (US intrastate) and 1967 (US interstate) as an alternative to operator-assisted collect calling and manual "Zenith" or "Enterprise" numbers. This Inward Wide Area Telephone Service (InWATS) allowed calls to be made directly from anywhere in a predefined area by dialling the prefix 1‑800- and a seven-digit number.
The system initially provided no support for Automatic Number Identification and no itemised record of calls, instead requiring subscribers to obtain expensive fixed-rate lines which included some number of hours of inbound calling from a "band" of one or several U.S. states or Canadian provinces. Early InWATS 800 calling lacked the complex routing features offered with modern toll-free service. After competitive carriers were allowed to compete with AT&T in establishing toll-free service, the three digit exchange following the 800 prefix was linked to a specific destination carrier and area code; the number itself corresponded to specific telephone switching offices and trunk groups. All calls went to one central destination; there was no means to place a toll-free call to another country.
Despite its limitations (and the relatively high cost of long distance in that era), the system was adequate for the needs of large volume users such as hotel chains, airlines and hire car firms which used it to build a truly national presence.
For small regional businesses who received few long-distance calls, the original InWATS was prohibitively expensive. As a fixed-rate bulk service requiring special trunks, it was suited only to large volume users.

Modern direct-dial systems[edit]
Modern toll-free service became possible when telephone companies replaced their electro-mechanical switching systems with computerized switching systems. This allowed toll-free calls to be routed based on instructions located in central databases.
In the United States, AT&T engineer Roy P. Weber from Bridgewater, New Jersey patented a 'Data Base Communication Call Processing Method' which was deployed by AT&T in 1982. The called number was an index into a database, allowing a 'Toll-Free Call' or '800 Call' to be directed anywhere.[7] This feature and other advances that made it possible were what led to AT&T marketing analyst Dodge Cepeda from Bedminster, New Jersey to propose the introduction of providing 800 Toll-Free Service to small and medium-size business customers on a nationwide basis. Once this service was implemented, it became possible for the very smallest of business operations to have potential customers contact them free of charge at a time when long-distance calling was expensive. Until this time, 800 Service was only available to major Fortune 500 companies.
In the United Kingdom, BT introduced "Linkline" on 12 November 1985. No more need to manually ring the operator, two new prefixes 0800 (an automated toll-free service which became "Freefone") and 0345 (a shared-cost service marketed as "Lo-Call" because initially its rates resembled those of local calls) could be reached by direct dial.[8] Cable and Wireless used 0500 and 0645, in much the same way, just a few years later.

Vanity numbering[edit]

A toll-free vanity number, custom toll-free number, or mnemonic is easy to remember; it spells and means something or it contains an easily recognized numeric pattern. An easily remembered number is valued as a branding and direct response tool in business advertising.
In the United States, Federal Communications Commission regulations mandate that numbers be allocated on a first come, first served basis; this gives vanity number operators who register as RespOrgs a strong advantage in obtaining the most valuable phonewords, as they have first access to newly disconnected numbers and to newly introduced toll-free area codes. In Australia, premium numbers, such as the 13-series or the vanity phone words, are distributed by auction separately from the administrative procedure to assign random, generic numbers from the available pool.

Shared use[edit]
In toll-free telephony, a shared-use number is a vanity number (usually a valuable generic phone word), which is rented to multiple local companies in the same line of business in different cities. These appear in Australia (1300 and 1800) and North America (1‑800, etc.); in the U.S., the RespOrg infrastructure is used to direct calls for the same number to different vendors based on the area code of the calling number.
As one example, a taxi company could rent shared use of 1‑800‑TAXICAB in one city. The number belongs to a company in Van Nuys, California,[9] but is redirected to local cab companies on a city-by-city basis[10] and promoted by being printed on everything from individual taxi cab hub caps[11] to campaigns against drunk driving.[12] Another example is Mark Russell's 1‑800‑GREATRATE, a shared-use number rented to lenders in various cities nationwide for a monthly fee.[13]
One former Mercedes dealer obtained 1‑800‑MERCEDES, charging other dealers to receive calls to that number from their local areas. The automaker unsuccessfully sued MBZ Communications of Owatonna, Minnesota, operated by former Mercedes dealer Donald Bloom, alleging deception and trademark infringement.[13][14] Mercedes was ultimately forced to obtain a different number, 1-800-FOR-MERCEDES.[15]
A company renting 1‑800‑RED‑CROSS at a premium price to individual local Red Cross chapters as "shared use" was less fortunate; the Federal Communications Commission reassigned that number to the American Red Cross as an emergency response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[16]
Shared use can be used as a means to circumvent FCC regulations against "warehousing, hoarding and brokering" toll-free numbers as technically the number is not being sold, only rented one city or region at a time. The practice is nonetheless potentially problematic as it leaves local businesses advertising numbers which they do not own and for which they therefore have no number portability. The cost per minute and per month is typically far higher for a shared-use number than for a standard toll-free vanity number which a local business controls outright, and there is little protection if the shared use company fails to meet its obligations or ceases operation.
There are also technical limitations; voice over IP users in particular are difficult to geolocate as their calls may be gated to the public switched telephone network at a point hundreds or thousands of miles away from their actual location. A roaming mobile or Internet telephone user is effectively (like the user of a foreign exchange line) attached to a distant rate centre far from their physical address.
If a program like Crime Stoppers is inherently regional or local, but its national 1‑800‑222‑TIPS number is shared between multiple exchanges, the exchange accepting the call must determine whether the call belongs to some other region.[citation needed]

International implementations[edit]

The implementation of toll-free calling by assigning special telephone numbers for charging a destination party is implemented in many countries by various dialing prefixes in the local number plan.

In Argentina, the prefix for toll-free numbers is "0800", followed by seven digits (the first three of them are fixed for each operator, so the user may know which carrier is serving the party they are calling). These numbers are called "0‑800" (cero ochocientos) or líneas gratuitas (free lines). There is also a local-rate service named "0-810" (cero ochocientos diez) where the calling party pays the fee for a local call and the called party pays for the long-distance fees.
In Armenia, the toll-free prefix is "800" followed by a five-digit number.
In Australia, the toll-free prefix is "1800" followed by a six-digit number. Calls are free from any landline and generally free from mobiles, although some mobile providers may charge their own fee.  A fixed-cost fee (usually the cost of a local call) is payable by the caller to "1300" and "13" prefix numbers (followed by six and four digits respectively).
In Austria, the prefix for toll-free numbers is also "0800", but only followed by six digits. They are commonly referred to as null-achthunderter Nummern (zero-eight hundred numbers).
In Azerbaijan, the prefix for toll -free numbers is 088, followed with seven digits. Toll Free calls are available both from mobile and landline phone operators.
In Belgium, the prefix "0800" is used for toll-free numbers, followed by 5 digits. They are commonly referred to as nul-achthonderd nummers (zero-eight hundred numbers) in Dutch, numéros verts (green numbers) in French or "null-achthunderter Nummern" (zero-eight hundred numbers) in the German speaking area.
In Brazil, the toll-free prefix is "0800". Although regular landline numbers in Brazil are 8 digits long, the toll-free prefix is usually followed by 7 digits, with 6 digits formerly common. Toll-free numbers in Brazil can be accessed from any telephone (by default) within the country, with many exceptions. They can only be accessed from outside Brazil by using a calling service (such as voice-over-Internet services or MCI Worldcom calling service) that accesses numbers from within the called country. Many toll-free numbers are not available from cell phones (usually blocked by the cell phone provider rather than by the provider of the toll-free number, in an effort to prevent low-price competition from calling card providers). Some toll-free numbers are not available from phones listed by the owner of the number, including many payphones. There is no special name for the service and when such a number is advertised, there is usually a remark that the call is free.
In Bulgaria, the toll-free prefix is "0800" followed by a five-digit number (up to now, only 1XXXX and 20ххх numbers have been allocated). These numbers are called Зелен номер (green number) by Vivacom and Зелена линия (green line) by A1.
In Canada, toll-free numbers are drawn from the US SMS/800 database. A seven-digit number 310-xxxx (not a true toll-free, but may be called from anywhere in its home area code at local rates from certain, but not all, carriers) is available in Bell Canada and Telus territories. From a landline, these are free. From cell phones, airtime is not covered, but there are no long-distance charges.
In Chile, the toll-free prefix is "800" followed by a six-digit number. These numbers are called número 800 (800 number). These numbers cannot be accessed from abroad.
In Colombia, toll-free numbers start with "018000".
In Croatia, the prefix for toll-free numbers is "0800".
In the Czech Republic, the toll-free prefix is "800".[17]
In Denmark telephone-numbers have eight digits. The toll-free numbers all begin with "80" followed by six further digits.
The Dominican Republic is assigned specific 1‑800 exchanges in the North American Numbering Plan; the 1-809-200-xxxx exchange is also free for domestic callers in that country.
In Egypt, it starts with "0800" followed by a seven-digit number. Unavailable via cellphones.
In Ecuador, it starts with "1800" followed by a 6-digit number. Some numbers have either regional or nationwide access. Calls from cellphones are only allowed by the operator Alegro which charges a few cents for these calls. PORTA and Movistar do not allow the service.
In France the "0800" or "0805" prefix is used for toll-free numbers. They are also known as numéros verts (green numbers).
In Finland, the toll-free prefix is "0800".
In Germany, the toll-free prefix is "'0800" followed by a seven-digit number. The "0801" prefix is already reserved for future use. The prefix used to be "0130". Deutsche Telekom calls these numbers "freecall 0800", most Germans refer to it simply as null-achthunderter Nummern (zero-eight hundred numbers).
In Georgia, the prefix for toll-free numbers is 0800 followed with six digits. Toll-free calls are available both from mobile and landline phone operators.
In Greece, the toll-free prefix is "800" followed by a seven-digit number or "807" followed by a four-digit number, used for phone card services only.
In Hong Kong, toll-free numbers have the "800" prefix.[18]
In Hungary, toll-free numbers have the "80" prefix.
In Iceland, the toll-free prefix is "800", followed by a four-digit number.
In India, the toll-free prefix is "1800", followed by a six or seven digit number. They are free of charge if called from a mobile phone or a land line. The "1860" prefix followed by seven digits is used for local-rate numbers. The calling party pays the local rate and the called party pays long-distance call charges (if any).
In Indonesia, the toll-free prefix is "0800-1", followed by a six-digit number.
In Ireland, 1800-xxxxxx numbers are freephones, with the 1800 71xxxx reserved for services that expect unusually high volumes of calls (e.g. radio station phone-in lines).[19]
In Israel, toll-free numbers are prefixed with "1800" followed by 6 digits (for local businesses); "180" or "189" followed by 7 digits usually refers to a free call to an overseas-operated calling center. The called party pays the charges for the call. As of 2012, calls from local cellular phone service providers to these prefixes are also free. Numbers prefixed with "1700" followed by 6 digits are local-rate numbers for the first 3–4 minutes, after which the charges for the remaining duration of the call are transferred to the receiving party (on a "shared cost" basis).
In Italy, toll-free numbers are dialed with the "800" or "803" prefix and are commonly referred to as numero verde (green number) or linea verde (green line). The numeri verdi used to begin with "1678" and later with "167".
NTT Communications trade mark for free dial, often used in print advertising.
In Japan, the prefixes "0120" and "0800" are officially assigned for toll-free numbers and are often referred to as "free dial" (フリーダイヤル) or "free call" (フリーコール) telephone numbers. These numbers are owned by NTT Communications (NTT Com). Several telephone carriers also provide toll-free services under their own company prefixes such as "0077" (these prefixes are also used for other toll services; the prefix "0570" is officially assigned for Navi Dial, a special toll service also operated by NTT Com).
In South Korea, toll-free numbers are prefixed with "080" (not to be confused with "060" or "070", which are used for pay-per-call/pay-per-minute information services or digital home phone services). Not all numbers with the "080" prefix are toll-free when called from a mobile phone.
In Latvia the prefix 8000-xx-xx is used for toll-free services. They are toll-free only when dialed from landlines, and charged the same as a land line when dialed from cell phones.
In Malaysia the prefix is 1800. Free if calling from a land-line and VoIP only. Calling from mobile phone will be considered a local call, with varying charges depending on the mobile network providers.
In Mexico the prefix is 800.
In Nepal the prefix is 1660.
In New Zealand, both "0800" or "0508" prefixes are referred to variously and interchangeably as "free phone" or "toll-free". Originally these "Oh-eight-hundred" numbers were provided by Spark New Zealand and "0508" by rival company Clear (now Vodafone New Zealand), although now both numbers can be provided by either company. Some older toll bar services designed to restrict toll calls (including long distance or calls to mobile phones) will also block calls to these free phone numbers, although this has become less common since the mid-1990s. A limited number of companies utilizing toll-free numbers will not accept calls from mobile phones. Some other free phone services exist, such as "*555" ("star five five five"), which can be dialled from cellular phones to report traffic conditions and incidents of dangerous driving.
In the Netherlands, the prefix "0800" is used for toll-free numbers. Calling 0800-numbers from fixed and mobile phones is free by law. UIFN's "00800" are generally free from fixed lines and charged for the airtime from mobile phones. UIFN access is not enforced by law, causing certain phone providers not to honor the standard.
In Norway most telephone-numbers have eight digits (with some exceptions). Toll-free numbers all begin with "800", followed by five further digits.
In Pakistan, toll-free numbers have the format "0800-xxxxx".
In Paraguay, the prefix "0800" is used for toll-free numbers, followed by 6 digits.
In the Philippines, the prefix for toll-free numbers is "1800" followed by either one, two, or four digits (examples include 8, 10, and 1888), and then by either a four- or seven-digit phone number. However, there are restrictions. Toll-free numbers are limited to the telephone network where the toll-free number is being handled. So, subscribers of a different telephone network company will not be able to call a toll-free number handled by a different telephone network. International toll-free numbers can only be accessed if the calling party is a PLDT subscriber.
In Poland, toll-free numbers have the format "800 xxx xxx". There are also split-charge numbers in the format "801 uxx xxx" (caller's cost depends on the digit u) and "universal numbers" in the format "804 uxx xxx", where the caller is automatically connected to the nearest office (these numbers are toll-free if u=3).
In Portugal, the prefix is "800" so the 9-digit number is "800 xxx xxx". It is referred as chamada gratuita (free call) or as número verde (green number).
In Qatar, toll-free numbers have the format "800' xxxx".[20]
In Romania, toll-free numbers have the format "0800 xxx xxx". The service is referred to as număr verde.
In Russia, the prefix is "8-800", followed by 7 digits (8-800-XXX-XX-XX).
In Serbia, the prefix "0-800", followed by a 6 or 7 digit number, is used.
In Singapore, the prefix "1800" followed by a 7 digit number is used. Calling from a mobile phone network will be considered a local call and charges vary among service providers.
In Slovakia, the toll-free prefix is "0800", followed by six digits. The local rate prefix is "0850".
In Slovenia, the prefix "080" is used for toll-free numbers, followed by four more digits.
In South Africa, the prefix "080", followed by 7 digits is used. It is referred to as a "toll-free" or "080" number (Afrikaans: tol-vrye).
In Spain, the "900XXXXXX" or "800XXXXXX" numbers are always toll-free (800 numbers are not usually used), "909XXXXXX" is used for dial-up Internet service and toll-free dialup Internet service (under subscription). Also "1002", "1004", "14XX", "15XX" and "16XX" are free and are used for the telecommunication providers call centers.
In Sweden, the prefix is "020" or "0200" for toll-free numbers. (Additionally, 0800 is reserved for future use.) These numbers are unreachable from other countries.
In Switzerland, the toll-free prefix is "0800"; it used to be "155". These numbers are called grüne Nummer (German) / numéro vert (French) / numero verde (Italian), all meaning "green number".
In Taiwan, the toll-free prefix is 0800-xxx-xxx or 0809-xxx-xxx, but not all Taiwanese mobile numbers can call toll free numbers. A toll-free subscriber can decide to restrict a number due to high per-minute mobile rates. This is cumbersome for the caller, who is told to dial another landline number, usually at the highest toll rate within the country as a mobile to landline call.  Some small VOIP operators also cannot call toll free numbers. For example, 0701-xxx-xxx cannot call toll free numbers directly, but can call through a live operator by dialling "123" and have them redirect the call.
In Thailand, for the Call Free, Free Call, Toll-Free, or Free Phone service, the format used is "1800-xxxxxx". Calls are free for all fixed line calls. Mobile carriers AIS and CAT (60+%o f Thailand's subscribers) offer 1-800 service for cell phones. DTAC and True mobile providers currently[when?] do not, but it is expected they will offer the 1-800 service for subscribers by late 2009.[needs update]
In Turkey, the prefix for toll-free numbers is "0800".
In the United Kingdom, modern freephone numbers start with 0800 or 0808, followed by a further 7 digits. Some older 0800 numbers still in use have a shorter number length. The former 0500 freephone number range was withdrawn on 5 June 2017.[21]
In Ukraine, toll-free numbers have the "0800" prefix, followed by 2 digits for the carrier code, then 4 digits for the client number - i.e., 0 800 YYXXXX. Before October 2009, the "8800" prefix was used.
In Vietnam, the prefix "1800" followed by a series of numbers, usually from 4 to 9 digits. All "1800" numbers are free of charge, but some of them cannot be dialled from all telephones.
In Kosovo, the toll-free prefix is "0800" followed by 5 digits.
Australia[edit]
Toll-free[edit]
Toll-free numbers in Australia are ten-digit numbers beginning with the prefix "1800".[22]
1800 numbers can also be found in Phonewords via an online auction.[23]
For all types, the recipient business pays for incoming toll charges, either per call or at flat rates.[24]
In some cases, 1800 numbers can be accessed from international lines.
Callers to an 1800 number are not charged a connection fee from a domestic fixed line. Calls from a mobile phone may incur charges depending on the provider.
The original prefix was 008. Such numbers were nine digits long. For example, the Crime Stoppers toll-free hotline was 008 333 000, sometimes (misleadingly) written as (008) 33 3000. Such numbers could be dialled from outside Australia, for example +61 08 333 0000
Local Rate numbers[edit]
A system similar to 1800 numbering exists where 6 or 10 digit numbers prefixed with 13 (one-three), 1300 or 1301 (colloquially one-three-hundred) can be called at local call rates regardless of the caller's location.

Callers to a 13 number are charged a "connection fee" by their telephone provider.
13 and 1300 numbers are often "smart routed" to the local outlet of chain stores or fast food premises. They may also be used by different companies in different regions.
13 numbers, 1300 numbers and 1800 numbers are relocatable across Australia, and can be transferred between different telecommunications suppliers.
13 numbers are a premium number scheme, subject to charges from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)[25] of approximately $10,000 per annum collected by the supplying carrier.
Premium numbers, such as those that spell a word using keypad letters, are regularly auctioned by the ACMA.[26]
Mobile telephones[edit]
Mobile callers are charged to phone a 1300 number or 1800 number, usually at their normal per minute rate, but sometimes at predatory rates. These expensive numbers can be decoded to ordinary landline and organisations usually offer a landline number on their websites, though it may be hard to find.
Smart routed 1800 or 13(00) numbers are sometimes not available from mobile phones as owners of the numbers may bar incoming calls from mobile devices due to higher call charges associated with such calls.
Canada[edit]
In addition to NANP toll-free numbers, carriers Bell Canada and Telus offer 310- numbers that can be accessed at local-call prices as shared-cost service (free from landlines, incurs local airtime charge from mobiles and local price from payphones). There are a few special mobile-only numbers (like *CAA to call the Canadian Automobile Association) which are free from cell phones, these are actually vertical service codes.

China[edit]
Calling an 800-number is free of charge. Calling a 400-number incurs a local access charge.
800-numbers are accessible only to land-line subscribers, while 400-numbers are accessible to all land-line and mobile users.
800-toll-free numbers[edit]
800 toll-free numbers are commonly called "800 免费电话". The official name is "被叫集中付费业务" (called party collect paid service), which means the cost of the call is borne not by the caller but by the party receiving the call.

800-toll-free numbers in China are ten-digit numbers beginning with "800". There is no prefix before "800".
800-toll-free numbers are not accessible to mobile network subscribers and some land-line subscribers. For instance China Tietong Telecom land-line users cannot access 800 numbers.
400-toll-free numbers[edit]
400-service is called "主被叫分摊付费业务" (calling party and called party split-paid service), which means the calling party pays for the local access fee and the called party pays the toll (long distance) fee.
400-toll-free numbers in China are ten-digit numbers beginning with "400".
400-toll-free numbers can be accessed by all fixed-line and mobile phones.
Callers have to bear local access charges from their service providers.
400-toll-free numbers with prefix "4001" are international toll-free numbers which can be routed to destination numbers inside or outside China. 400 toll-free numbers with prefix "4000", "4006", "4007" or "4008" are national toll-free numbers which can be routed to China destination numbers only.
Netherlands[edit]
The introduction of 0800/0900 numbers in the Netherlands in 1986 has led to significant growth of call centres and an increase in outsourcing.[27]
Originally, free telephone numbers in the Netherlands started with either the 06-0, 06-4 or 06-3000 prefix. Most 0800-numbers cannot be called from abroad, and only few can be called from the Caribbean Netherlands (by dialing 0031800). 088-numbers are shared-cost; from landlines, the caller pays only the costs for a local call, whereas the receiver pays the rest.

United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom, toll-free telephone numbers are generally known as "freephone" numbers (British Telecom numbers use the previously trademarked term Freefone[28]) and begin with the prefixes 0800 or 0808. The most commonly used prefix is 0800, first used in November 1985.[29] Additionally, numbers in the range 0808 80x xxxx are reserved for not-for-profit helplines, through a scheme negotiated by the Helplines Partnership (now known as the Helplines Association).
Since 1 July 2015, all 0800 and 0808 numbers have been free to call from landlines and mobile phones alike.[30][31] Most mobile phone operators had charged for such calls previously, with Orange being the final major network to introduce such charges during December 2005. Certain helplines, such as those in the 0808 80x xxxx series had remained free from most networks on a voluntary basis and some niche operators, such as Giffgaff always offered freephone calls at no charge.[32]
The UK mobile operators offer an alternative product to organisations who wish to provide toll-free services - 5-digit voice short codes which are sold through mobile aggregators.
0500 numbers, introduced by Mercury Communications (later known as Cable & Wireless, now Vodafone) in 1982, were also freephone numbers (known as "FreeCall"), but were officially withdrawn by Ofcom on 3 June 2017. A three-year transition period prior to that had allowed existing subscribers to migrate to matching 080 85 numbers with the same final 6 digits as before.[33] While the numbers had been portable, the 0500 range had been closed to new allocations since 1997/98.[34]
0500 numbers had six more digits after the prefix. 0800 numbers can have six or seven digits after the prefix. 0808 numbers have seven digits after the prefix.
Freephone numbers in the range 08081 570000 to 570999 are blocked out by Ofcom for use as fictitious telephone numbers.[35]

United States[edit]
Main article: Toll-free telephone numbers in the United States
Toll-free numbers in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) are commonly called "800-numbers" after the first area code assigned for the service. Today, several prefixes are used: 800 (since January 1, 1966), 888 (since March 1, 1996),  877 (since April 4, 1998), 866 (since July 29, 2000), 855 (since October 9, 2010),[36] 844 (since December 7, 2013),[37] and 833 (since June 3, 2017[38]).
Area codes reserved for future expansion of the service include 822, 880 through 887, and 889.[39]
The original Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) is obsolete. North American toll-free numbers are controlled by an intelligent network database (SMS/800) in which any toll-free number may be directed to any geographic telephone number under the control of any of various RespOrgs.[40] Direct inward dialing and toll-free number portability are supported; various providers offer gateways which receive free phone calls on PRI lines and deliver them to voice over IP or pager users.
Toll free numbers usually capture the telephone number of the caller for billing purposes through automatic number identification, which is independent of caller ID data and functions even if caller ID is blocked.[41]

Universal International Freephone Service[edit]
"UIFN" redirects here. For the 2011 Carnifex album, see Until I Feel Nothing.
Universal International Freephone Service is an international service, assigned the country code 800 by the International Telecommunication Union. The intention is that any customer in the world can dial the same number to reach a business subscribing to a number, and at no charge to the calling party. However, only a limited number of countries participate. In order to participate, countries must agree on the amount of revenue they will retain (to cover their costs of network transport) while still forwarding sufficient revenue to cover the recipient's costs of subscribing.
A Universal International Freephone Number (UIFN) is a worldwide toll-free "800 number" issued by the ITU. Like the 800 area code issued for the NANP in the U.S. and Canada and 0800 numbers in many other countries, the call is free for the caller while the receiver pays the charges. UIFN uses ITU country code 800 so that no matter where the caller is, only the international access code (IAC), the UIFN country code (800) and the 8-digit UIFN need to be dialed. As of March 2020, 144 carriers in 67 countries participate in the UIFN program;[42] free access to the numbers (as international calls) from mobile and coin telephones is not universal. Registration of a +800 number incurs a 300 Swiss franc ITU fee (as of 2018) in addition to any charges levied by the individual carrier. The number must be activated for inbound calls from at least two telephone country codes within 180 days.[43]
The +800 UIFN service is one of three ITU-administered non-geographic codes with a similar numbering scheme. The +808 Universal International Shared Cost Number (UISCN), billed at the price of a domestic call, shares the same eight-digit format; the +979 Universal International Premium Rate Number (UIPRN), billed at a high premium cost, carries one extra digit to indicate price range.

Universal International Shared Cost Number (UISCN) is part of the E.164 telephone numbering space that includes international telephone numbers where the call costs are split between the caller and the called. An international shared-cost number allows the calling party to make the call at national rates, since the costs of any international routing will be borne by the called party.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has allocated the country code 808 to this service.
As of 2023, the only companies that had requested UISCN number allocation were Swisscom (Switzerland), SMSRelay (Switzerland, now defunct) and Mr Next Id (now DTMS; Germany).[1]
